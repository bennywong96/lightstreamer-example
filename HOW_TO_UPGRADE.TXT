HOW TO UPGRADE LIGHTSTREAMER
============================

First of all, please see CHANGELOG.HTML to know all the differences from
the previous versions of the Lightstreamer components.

---------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from 7.0.3 build 20190107 to This Version
---------------------------------------------------

If you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer 7.0.3 build 20190107,
then this new release only brings a few bug fixes and minor interface changes
in the various Unified Client SDKs, whereas the Server has not changed.

So, you can leave the Server installation unchanged.
In order to upgrade the clients, read carefully through the CHANGELOG to learn
about any possible compatibility issues. In particular, if you run the Server
with a license of "file" type, a license upgrade may be needed.

---------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from 7.0.2 build 20181003 to This Version
---------------------------------------------------

If you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer 7.0.2 build 20181003,
then this new release only brings a few bug fixes on the Server and the
various Unified client SDKs (with minor interface changes). It also lists
the new SDK for .NET Standard Clients, recently made available on NuGet.

Still, we suggest you to do a fresh install of Lightstreamer 7.0.3, then:

- CONFIGURATION:
  You can copy your configuration files under the "conf" folder
  (e.g. lightstreamer_conf.xml, lightstreamer_log_conf.xml)
  unchanged in the new installation.
  If you have changed the launch scripts under "bin" (e.g. LS.sh, LS.bat),
  you can also copy them in the new installation.

- ADAPTERS:
  You can deploy your existing Adapter binaries unchanged.

- CLIENTS:
  The Server is compatible with previous client libraries, so your
  existing clients should work with no issues.
  In order to upgrade the clients, read carefully through the CHANGELOG
  to learn about any possible compatibility issues. In particular, if you run
  the Server with a license of "file" type, a license upgrade may be needed.

- MPN MODULE DATABASE (where available):
  You can keep the database unchanged.

---------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from 7.0.1 build 20180614 to This Version
---------------------------------------------------

If you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer 7.0.1 build 20180614,
then this new release only brings a few bug fixes on the Server and adds
compatibility with Java 11. However, the latter involves a change in the
deployed third-party libraries.
The release also brings a few bug fixes on some client SDKs (with minor
interface changes). It also lists the new SDK for .NET Standard Clients,
recently made available on NuGet.

So, we suggest you to do a fresh install of Lightstreamer 7.0.3, then:

- CONFIGURATION:
  You can copy your configuration files under the "conf" folder
  (e.g. lightstreamer_conf.xml, lightstreamer_log_conf.xml)
  unchanged in the new installation.
  On the other hand, if you have changed the launch scripts under "bin"
  (e.g. LS.sh, LS.bat), take note of any changes you performed and apply
  them to the new factory files.

- ADAPTERS:
  You can deploy your existing Adapter binaries unchanged.

- CLIENTS:
  The Server is compatible with previous client libraries, so your
  existing clients should work with no issues.
  In order to upgrade the clients, read carefully through the CHANGELOG
  to learn about any possible compatibility issues. In particular, if you run
  the Server with a license of "file" type, a license upgrade may be needed.

- MPN MODULE DATABASE (where available):
  You can keep the database unchanged.

---------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from 7.0.0 build 20180228 to This Version
---------------------------------------------------

If you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer 7.0.0 build 20180228,
then this new release brings bug fixes and various improvements
in the Server and some client SDKs (one of which is brand new:
the SDK for .NET Standard Clients).
The release also brings compatibility with Java 11 and discontinues the
support for Java 6 on the Server. This involves a change in the deployed
third-party libraries.

So, we suggest you to do a fresh install of Lightstreamer 7.0.3, then:

- CONFIGURATION:
  You can copy your configuration files under the "conf" folder
  (e.g. lightstreamer_conf.xml, lightstreamer_log_conf.xml)
  unchanged in the new installation.
  On the other hand, if you have changed the launch scripts under "bin"
  (e.g. LS.sh, LS.bat), take note of any changes you performed and apply
  them to the new factory files.
  However, if you have enabled the https support, we suggest you porting
  the main configuration file, lightstreamer_conf.xml, using the online
  Configuration File Upgrade Tool; it is available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

- ADAPTERS:
  You can deploy your existing Adapter binaries unchanged.

- CLIENTS:
  The Server is compatible with previous client libraries, so your
  existing clients should work with no issues. This will allow you to upgrade
  the server *before* upgrading the clients. When you are ready to upgrade
  the clients, read carefully through the CHANGELOG to learn about any possible
  compatibility issues and if you need to recompile your code.
  In particular, in order to upgrade some Client SDKs, if you run the Server
  with a license of "file" type, a license upgrade may be needed.
  
  The Server upgrade to 7.0.3 also implies the upgrade of the
  JMX Extension SDK to version 5.4.4. However, If using custom managers,
  you can keep them unchanged.

- MPN MODULE DATABASE (where available):
  You can keep the database unchanged.

---------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from 6.1.0 build 20170123 to This Version
---------------------------------------------------

If you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer 6.1.0 build 20170123,
then this new release brings a brand new licensing mechanism, a wholly
revised MPN module and several improvements to the Server (including
compatibility with Java 11) and some client SDKs.
In particular, new client SDKs for Unity, .NET Standard, and watchOS have
been added and some obsolete SDKs have been removed (although clients based
on them keep being supported).

However, if you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer Moderato 6.1.0
build 20170123 and are upgrading to this release by leveraging the Community
edition, then the new release also brings many client SDKs previously not
included (only one of which can be activated) and several features that
previously were hidden, but that are still unavailable.

So we suggest you to do a fresh install of Lightstreamer 7.0.3, then:

- CONFIGURATION:
  The lightstreamer_version_conf.xml file was replaced by the brand
  new lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml.
  Since license configuration was totally revised, you need to pass through
  the new file to configure properly the Lightstreamer Edition and License
  Type, according with your current contractual terms.
  Moreover, any changes you performed in lightstreamer_version_conf.xml
  to the <proxy> block and the <audit_log_path>, <automatic_update_check>,
  and <automatic_audit_upload> elements should also be applied to
  lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml.

  Take note of the changes you performed on the other configuration files under
  the "conf" folder (e.g. lightstreamer_conf.xml, lightstreamer_log_conf.xml)
  and apply your changes to the new factory configuration files.
  Do the same for the launch scripts under "bin" (e.g. LS.sh, LS.bat).
  For lightstreamer_conf.xml and lightstreamer_log_conf.xml, this may not be
  easy, so we suggest you using the online Configuration File Upgrade Tool;
  it is available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

  However, if you are leveraging the MPN module, hence
  you have modified the <mpn> block in lightstreamer_conf.xml and the files
  under "conf/mpn", please contact Lightstreamer support for further
  instructions.

- ADAPTERS:
  The Server upgrade to 7.0.3 also implies the upgrade of the
  Adapter Remoting Infrastructure to version 1.8.1.

  Your adapters.xml files should be revised according with the CHANGELOG for
  the relevant SDK (i.e. Java In-Process Adapters SDK or Adapter Remoting
  Infrastructure). To simplify the operation, we suggest you using the online
  Configuration File Upgrade Tool; it is available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

  After that, you can deploy your existing Adapter binaries unchanged, unless
  the MPN module is involved. If leveraging the MPN module,
  please read carefully through the CHANGELOG for all the details changed.

- CLIENTS:
  The Server is compatible with previous client libraries, so your
  existing clients should work with no issues. This will allow you to upgrade
  the server *before* upgrading the clients. When you are ready to upgrade
  the clients, read carefully through the CHANGELOG to learn about any possible
  compatibility issues and if you need to recompile your code.

  However, if leveraging the MPN module (possible with some
  old client SDKs), consider that the support for Push Notifications on such
  old clients has been dropped and all client requests will be refused by the
  new Server. In that case, a porting to the newest client SDK will be needed.
  
  The Server upgrade to 7.0.3 also implies the upgrade of the
  JMX Extension SDK to version 5.4.4. If using custom managers, you can keep
  them unchanged, unless you are using statistics related with the MPN module.
  In that case, please look for compatibility issues in the related CHANGELOG.

- MPN MODULE DATABASE (where available):
  If leveraging the MPN module, the database should be migrated when ported
  to the new Server. To achieve that, please contact Lightstreamer support
  for instructions.

-----------------------------------------------
Upgrading from 6.0 or any 6.0.x to This Version
-----------------------------------------------

If you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer 6.0 build 20150121
through 6.0.3 build 20160905, you can refer to this same document for
Lightstreamer 6.1.0 and follow the provided instructions. After that,
reconsider the previous paragraph.

Note that, if you have an existing installation of Lightstreamer Moderato
and are upgrading to this release by leveraging the Community edition,
in the previous step you should refer to Lightstreamer Moderato 6.1.0.

Alternatively, to upgrade in a single step, we suggest you to do a fresh
install of Lightstreamer 7.0.3, then:

- CONFIGURATION:
  The lightstreamer_version_conf.xml file was replaced by the brand
  new lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml.
  Since license configuration was totally revised, you need to pass through
  the new file to configure properly the Lightstreamer Edition and License
  Type, according with your current contractual terms.
  Moreover, any changes you performed in lightstreamer_version_conf.xml
  to the <proxy> block and the <audit_log_path>, <automatic_update_check>,
  and <automatic_audit_upload> elements should also be applied to
  lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml.

  Then use the online Configuration File Upgrade Tool to automatically convert
  your configuration files to 7.0.3. Supported files are lightstreamer_conf.xml
  and lightstreamer_log_conf.xml in the "conf" folder (also for Lightstreamer
  Moderato). The online Configuration File Upgrade Tool is available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

  For other configuration files under "conf" and the launch scripts under bin
  (e.g. LS.sh, LS.bat), take note of any changes you performed and apply them
  to the new factory files.
  However, if you launch the Server with custom scripts, please check the
  "compatibility notes" in the Server CHANGELOG.

- ADAPTERS:
  The Server upgrade to 7.0.3 also implies the upgrade of the
  Adapter Remoting Infrastructure to version 1.8.1.

  Use the online Configuration File Upgrade Tool to automatically convert
  your adapters.xml files to 7.0.3 (Lightstreamer Moderato also supported).
  The tool is available at:
  https://service.lightstreamer.com/ConfigUpgrade

  After that, you can deploy your existing Adapter binaries unchanged, unless
  the MPN module is involved. If leveraging the MPN module,
  please read carefully through the CHANGELOG for all the details changed.

- CLIENTS:
  The Server is compatible with previous client libraries, so your
  existing clients should work with no issues. This will allow you to upgrade
  the server *before* upgrading the clients. When you are ready to upgrade
  the clients, read carefully through the CHANGELOG to learn about any possible
  compatibility issues and if you need to recompile your code.

  However, if leveraging the MPN module (possible with some
  old client SDKs), consider that the support for Push Notifications on such
  old clients has been dropped and all client requests will be refused by the
  new Server. In that case, a porting to the newest client SDK will be needed.

  If you are using the .NET or Windows Phone or winRT SDK, you should move
  to the new .NET PCL SDK, which exposes the same interface.

  The Server upgrade to 7.0.3 also implies the upgrade of the
  JMX Extension SDK to version 5.4.4. If using custom managers, you can keep
  them unchanged, unless you are using statistics related with the MPN module.
  In that case, please look for compatibility issues in the related CHANGELOG.

- MPN MODULE DATABASE (where available):
  If leveraging the MPN module, the database should be migrated when ported
  to the new Server. To achieve that, please contact Lightstreamer support
  for instructions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from all Previous Versions (before 6.0) to This Version
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to this same document for Lightstreamer 6.1.0 and follow the provided
instructions. After that, reconsider the previous paragraph.

Note that, if upgrading from Lightstreamer Moderato, in the previous step
you should refer to Lightstreamer Moderato 6.1.0.
