<div class="box">
<div class="component">Lightstreamer Server</div>


<div class="version">7.0.3 build 1885.8</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with the deployment structure of the previous version.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with configuration files for the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="compatibility">Compatible with the database of the MPN Module for the previous version.</div></span>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 7 Jan 2019</div></span>

<p>Fixed an annoying bug introduced in version 7.0.1 and affecting the "relative appenders"
   provided with the Server and preconfigured in the factory log configuration file as LSRolling
   and LSDailyRolling. Upon the first modification (of any kind) of the file while the Server
   was running, the position of the generated log files would have changed and become relative
   to the launch directory instead of the configuration file directory, until the next restart.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which could have caused a ClassCastException during update forwarding.
   As a consequence, this would have caused a streaming session to be suddenly closed
   with error code 43. The bug was triggered by a rare race condition, only possible
   with items subscribed to in both RAW and MERGE mode.</p>

<p>Fixed the check that at least one custom Adapter Set is defined. A warning log
   saying "No custom Adapter Set defined." might have been issued (or not issued) wrongly.</p>

<p>Completed the support for .NET Standard Client SDK, recently published on NuGet,
   which was partial in the preexisting versions of the Server. Added, in particular,
   handling of Session recovery, support in edition configuration file,
   and dedicated fields in the "monitor_details" item of the Monitoring Data Adapter.</p>


<div class="version">7.0.2 build 1885.3</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with the deployment structure of the previous version;
see the compatibility notes below.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with configuration files for the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="compatibility">Compatible with the database of the MPN Module for the previous version.</div></span>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 3 Oct 2018</div></span>

<p>Ensured runtime compatibility with Java 11; this involves changes
   <span class="notInAMS"> and additions</span>
   of third party libraries, as well as changes in the launch script.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: As the updated libraries have different
   names, if upgrading an existing installation, make sure you have removed the previous
   version of the libraries first. Moreover, if using a custom launch script,
   ensure that the new libraries are now referred.</span>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If an existing installation
   uses a custom launch script, the changes should be ported.</span></p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in version 6.0.2 which prevented the handling of JVM
   variable expansion in the main configuration file, when such variables were used
   to define tag attributes.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the reporting of unexpected exceptions on some Websocket requests,
   which caused a nullPointerException to be reported instead.</p>

<p>Removed spurious startup log messages, possible when starting with the
   factory configuration file, mentioning duplicated &lt;remove_protocols&gt;
   settings.</p>

<p>Fixed the preconfigured error page, ErrorPage.html, which was not aligned after
   renaming the internal logo in version 7.0.1. This renaming was in turn missed
   in 7.0.1 changelog. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If you have
   configured a customized error page, which, nevertheless, still links Lightstreamer
   internal logo, it should be aligned as well.</span> Also improved the logo.</p>


<div class="version">7.0.1 build 1885</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with the deployment structure of the previous version;
see the compatibility notes below.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with configuration files for the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="compatibility">Compatible with the database of the MPN Module for the previous version.</div></span>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 14 Jun 2018</div></span>

<p>Introduced various improvements on the support for client https connections
   (see the &lt;https_server&gt; configuration block).
   </p><ul>
   <li>Improved the support for TLS session resumption (see the
   &lt;use_client_hints_for_TLS_session_resumption&gt; configuration element).</li>
   <li>Added support for server-side choice of the cipher suite to be used
   (see the &lt;enforce_server_cipher_suite_preference&gt; configuration
   element); the server-side choice is now also the suggested setting.<br/>
   This setting is also available in the &lt;rmi_connector&gt; block
   under &lt;jmx&gt;.</li>
   <li>Introduced the &lt;disable_TLS_renegotiation&gt; configuration
   element.</li>
   <li>Extended the suggested settings of &lt;remove_cipher_suites&gt;.
   and the suggested settings of &lt;remove_protocols&gt;.
   Note that this may be too restrictive for some old user agents.<br/>
   This also applies to the &lt;rmi_connector&gt; block under &lt;jmx&gt;.</li>
   <li>Introduced the support for keystore passwords written on a file
   (see the &lt;keystore&gt; block).<br/>
   The extension is also available for the &lt;truststore&gt; block and
   also applies to the &lt;rmi_connector&gt; block under &lt;jmx&gt;.</li>
   <li>Added checks for runtime replacement of the keystore file
   (see the &lt;keystore&gt; block).</li>
   </ul>

<p>Discontinued the support for java 6 SDK and runtime environment.
   Java 7 or later is now required.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: installations of the Server
   still based on a java 6 JVM have to be upgraded. Existing Adapters compiled
   for a java 6 SDK don't need to be upgraded.</span></p>

<p>Fixed a bug that, under conditions of huge activity and high parallelism,
   could have caused one or more threads to enter a strict loop and the whole
   Server to hang.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in 7.0.0 which caused the configuration of TLS/SSL
   on the JMX RMI connector to be refused as not licensed in case the DEMO
   license type was configured.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in 7.0.0 which caused the &lt;truststore&gt; configuration
   block in the &lt;https_server&gt; block to be ignored. This only affected
   the case in which either &lt;use_client_auth&gt; or &lt;force_client_auth&gt;
   (or both) was set to Y.</p>

<p>Fixed bug in MPN module that could have caused an error when a new Server
   instance was taking over devices from a previous instance. This would have
   caused delays in the takeover operation.</p>

<p>Improved handling of control requests targeted to closed sessions on WebSockets.
   Such requests might have been reported as "Bad request"; now a proper error
   notification will always be issued.</p>

<p>Clarifying some logging messages and improved logging in various ways:</p><ul>
   <li>Fixed some error messages in the MPN module reporting "Apple service" where,
   actually, "Google service" was meant.</li>
   <li>Removed some harmless occurrences the "Unexpected context ClassLoader found"
   warning.</li>
   <li>Removing the harmless "could not fulfill" warning message upon successful
   session recovery.</li>
   <li>Removed some error level log upon normal interruptions of https connections.</li>
   <li>Extended the internal cause codes on connection interruptions for timeouts.</li>
   </ul>

<p class="notInAMS">Added to the included Monitoring Dashboard (License tab) a section,
   only available when the online license validation is leveraged, which reports the
   number of Server instances currently active and validated for the same contract ID.</p>

<p>Improved the reporting of client IPs in the internal Monitoring Data Adapter
   and Monitoring Dashboard.</p>

<p>Added a check to refuse session recovery requests specifying an event not yet sent;
   in fact, in principle, such request could be fulfilled, but they are implicitly
   forbidden by the specifications.</p>

<p>Aligned the Clustering.pdf document (paragraph 4) to account for the extension
   recently introduced in some client SDKs to notify the client of the Server's
   detection of wrong affinity.</p>

<p>Clarified the SSL Certificate.pdf document with respect to keytool limitations
   and acquisition of the certificate chain.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the included welcome page which caused malfunctioning in case of
   network issues. However, the welcome page is for internal use only.</p>


<div class="version">7.0.0 build 1860.2</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with the deployment structure of the previous version.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with configuration files for the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="compatibility">Compatible with the database of the MPN Module for the previous version.</div></span>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 23 Apr 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed a serious bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism,
   which could have caused update event duplication upon a successful recovery
   on clients based on the Web and Node.js client SDKs (of versions suitable
   for session recovery support). The bug was triggered by previous subscription
   requests that were refused, because illegal or disallowed by the Metadata Adapter
   (such errors are notified to the client application through onSubscriptionError
   or onCommandSecondLevelSubscriptionError).</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Fixed a compatibility issue which affected the validation
   of ONLINE licenses. With some custom configurations of the JVM security
   settings, a valid license could have been refused.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the handling of suspension of MPN devices returned
   by Apple’s feedback service. This prevented the removal of the devices.</p>

<p>Improved logging upon session recovery, by adding a missing log
   of the related bind_session request.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Slightly revised the log of online license checks.</p>


<div class="version">7.0.0 build 1860</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with the deployment structure of the previous version.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Not compatible with configuration files for the previous version;
see the compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with licensed features holding for the previous version;
see the compatibility notes below.</div></span>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="compatibility">Not compatible with the database of the MPN Module for the previous version;
see the compatibility notes below.</div></span>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 28 Feb 2018</div></span>

<div class="subsectionTitle">Systemwide Changes and Extensions</div>

<span class="notInAMS">

<p>Introduced two different editions: "COMMUNITY" for FREE license (replacing the old 
   "Moderato" edition) and "ENTERPRISE" for all other types of license (replacing the old 
   "Allegro/Presto/Vivace" editions).<br/>
   For this purpose, revised the licensing configuration, with the introduction
   of the new "lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml" configuration file, which replaces
   the old "lightstreamer_version_conf.xml". In particular, the &lt;license&gt; section
   has been heavily modified. See &lt;edition&gt; in the new "lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml"
   configuration file for details; and the specific section of each
   edition depending on your choice:<br/>
     - &lt;community_edition_details&gt;<br/>
     - &lt;enterprise_edition_details&gt;<br/>
   Also a new mandatory &lt;edition_conf&gt; configuration element in the main 
   configuration file "lightstreamer_conf.xml" has been introduced, replacing the old 
   &lt;version_conf&gt;. See the inline comments in the factory configuration
   file for details.
   <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: In existing installations, the new &lt;edition_conf&gt;
   element and "lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml" file must be added (and the old
   &lt;version_conf&gt; element must be removed).<br/>
   If previously using the "Moderato" package, configure the "COMMUNITY" edition;
   otherwise, configure the "ENTERPRISE" edition. In the latter case:
   </span></p><ul>
   <li><span class="compatibility">If using a "DEMO" license with "Vivace" edition
   configured, just keep the factory settings.</span></li>
   <li><span class="compatibility">If using a "DEMO" license with other editions
   configured, start from the factory settings, but restrict the feature set
   accordingly (see below).</span></li>
   <li><span class="compatibility">If using a "LICENSE_SERVER" or "LICENSE_FILE",
   ask for a license upgrade, with instructions on how to configure it.</span></li>
   </ul>
   <p><span class="compatibility">The currently used "lightstreamer_version_conf.xml"
   file should be abandoned, and any changes to the &lt;proxy&gt; block and the
   &lt;audit_log_path&gt;, &lt;automatic_update_check&gt;, and &lt;automatic_audit_upload&gt;
   elements should be ported to the new "lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml" configuration file.
   </span></p>
   
<p>For DEMO licenses, introduced the possibility to only activate the
   optional features you want to use, instead of choosing only among the three old available
   editions. See the &lt;optional_features&gt; section in the "lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml"
   configuration file.<br/>
   For online-validated licenses (previously the LICENSE_SERVER type), the optional features
   are now provided by your license, instead of choosing among the three old available
   editions. Yet, it is still possible to furtherly restrict the optional features
   you want to use through the &lt;optional_features&gt; section.<br/>
   Also for file-based licenses (previously the LICENSE_FILE type) it is now possible
   to furtherly restrict the optional features you want to use through the
   &lt;optional_features&gt; section.</p>
   
<p>The COMMUNITY edition allows to choose one of the available Client SDKs
   to use with the Lightstreamer Server; instead, the old "Moderato"
   edition forced Web, Node.js, and Flash client SDKs. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If upgrading from "Moderato" to "COMMUNITY" edition,
   whereas Web, Node.js, and Flash client SDKs were all enabled at the same time,
   now only one of them can be enabled at the same time.</span></p>

</span>
<span class="notInAPV">

<p>Revised the licensing configuration, with the introduction
   of the new "lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml" configuration file, which replaces
   the old "lightstreamer_version_conf.xml".<br/>
   Also a new mandatory &lt;edition_conf&gt; configuration element in the main 
   configuration file "lightstreamer_conf.xml" has been introduced, replacing the old 
   &lt;version_conf&gt;. See the inline comments in the factory configuration
   file for details.
   <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: In existing installations, the new &lt;edition_conf&gt;
   element and "lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml" file must be added (and the old
   &lt;version_conf&gt; element must be removed).<br/>
   The currently used "lightstreamer_version_conf.xml" file should be abandoned</span></p>

<p>Introduced the possibility to deactivate some features you don't want to use,
   instead of sticking to the features provided by the license.
   See the &lt;optional_features&gt; section in the "lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml"
   configuration file.</p>

<p>Introduced the possibility to customize the path of the generated audit logs
   through the &lt;audit_logs&gt; block in the "lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml"
   configuration file. However, with this edition, the generation of audit logs
   has been discontinued and is no longer available.</p>

</span>

<p>Wholly revised the support for Mobile Push Notifications
   offered through the internal MPN Module.
   The support is now available through the recently introduced TLCP client protocol.
   This makes it part of the SDK for Generic Clients and enables support on more client SDKs.<br/>
   See the MPN chapter on the General Concepts document for all the details.
   But in particular, the revision brings the following consequences:</p>
   <ul>
        <li>Reserved the Adapter Set name "MPN_INTERNAL_ADAPTER_SET" (only when the
        MPN Module is enabled). <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
        in the very unlikely case of a name conflict with a custom Adapter Set, the Server
        will refuse to start and the custom Adapter Set will have to be renamed.</span></li>

        <li>Added an internal Data Adapter in all Adapter Sets (only when the MPN Module
        is enabled). It is available for queries related with MPN state by the various client
        SDKs. Note that client subscription requests for the new Adapter will not be submitted
        to the custom Metadata Adapter and will be handled in the SERVER thread pool.<br/>
        The Adapter is hidden from the Adapter Set configuration and its name is now
        reserved (again, only when the MPN Module is enabled); the name can be configured
        through the new &lt;internal_data_adapter&gt; flag in the &lt;mpn&gt; block.
        <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: in the very unlikely case of
        a name conflict with a custom Data Adapter, the Server will refuse to start;
        anyway, the name can be reconfigured properly.</span></li>
        
        <li>Changed the names used to identify the platforms, according to the changes 
        in the SDK for In-Process Adapters. This affects platform-specific:<ol>
            <li>Logger names.</li>
            <li>Log messages and error messages.</li>
            <li>Thread pool names.</li>
            <li>Configuration elements provided in the &lt;mpn&gt; block to specify
            the notifier configuration files.</li>
            <li>Names of the top-level elements of the notifier configuration files.</li>
            <li>Factory names and paths of the notifier configuration files.</li>
        </ol>
        <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: In any existing installation
        in which the MPN Module is enabled, the use of platform names should be verified.
        Points 4 and 5 above are certainly involved and have to be addressed. Point 6
        changes the deployment structure and should be addressed for clarity,
        but does not pose compatibility issues.</span></li>

        <li>Reduced the default value of the &lt;min_send_delay_millis&gt; configuration
        flag, to request more frequent notifications to the third-party Push Notification Service.
        Moreover, for notifications related to triggers, this restriction is no longer applied.</li>
        
        <li>Discontinued the application of the &lt;reaction_on_database_failure&gt;
        configuration flag in the specific case of badge management.
        The "abort_operation" policy will always be adopted.</li>
        
        <li>Added the &lt;notifier_pools&gt; and &lt;composer_pool_size&gt; configuration
        flags to the &lt;mpn&gt; block of the main configuration file, to replace
        the same flags available in the platform-specific configuration files.
        <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If the flags are used in an existing
        installation, the new one should be leveraged. However, if the flag has different
        values for different services, the differentiation cannot be kept. In any case,
        it is recommended to remove the old flags, to avoid confusion.</span></li>
        
        <li>Renamed the &lt;subscription_timeout_minutes&gt; configuration flag to
        &lt;device_inactivity_timeout_minutes&gt;. <span class="compatibility">
        COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing configuration files should be aligned.</span></li>

        <li>Introduced a garbage collection of devices that remain too long with no
        subscriptions. The timeout is enforced by the existing (but newly renamed)
        &lt;device_inactivity_timeout_minutes&gt; configuration flag. Added the related
        &lt;collector_period_minutes&gt; configuration flag in the &lt;mpn&gt; block.</li>

        <li>Improved the detection, logging, and recovery of failed attemps to send
        APNS Notifications.</li>

        <li>Changed in various parts the schema of the database used by the MPN Module.
        This also affects the factory hibernate configuration files under conf/mpn.
        <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: In any existing installation
        in which the MPN Module is enabled, the database should be migrated before
        running the new Server.<span class="notInAMS"> To achieve that, please
        contact Lightstreamer support for instructions.</span></span></li>
        
        <li>Changed the factory configuration of the database, to suggest HSQLDB for
        the first tests.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><span class="notInAPV">However, the MPN Module is not available with
   this edition.</span></p>

<p>Discontinued the support for Mobile Push Notifications
   for clients based on the previous version of the MPN Module. This affects the
   old non-Unified-API versions of the Android, iOS, and macosOS Client SDKs.
   The Server will remain formally compatible with these clients, but any request
   for Mobile Push Notification services will be actively refused.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing clients leveraging
   the Mobile Push Notifications support should be upgraded by porting them to the
   corresponding Unified-API versions of the old SDKs, which have now been extended
   with Mobile Push Notification support based on the new MPN Module.</span>
   <span class="notInAPV">However, the MPN Module is not available with
   this edition.</span></p>

<p>Introduced the support for the recovery of a session upon an interruption of a
   streaming or long polling connection. If the interruption is due to network
   issues, a client can request a rebind starting from the last event it received.
   See the new &lt;session_recovery_millis&gt;, &lt;max_recovery_length&gt;, and
   &lt;max_recovery_poll_length&gt; configuration elements for details.</p>

<p>Modified the default for the &lt;server_pool_max_size&gt; to become 1000.
   This should reduce the delays caused by slow adapters on those installations
   in which the settings for the SERVER thread pool and its optional subpools
   are not leveraged.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: For installations leaning
   on the default pool size, in case of slow adapters, the memory footprint could
   increase by about 1GB. If an installation cannot afford this memory increase,
   &lt;server_pool_max_size&gt; should be manually redefined. The previous
   default was the maximum between 10 and the number of cores.</span>
   Only if &lt;server_pool_max_size&gt; is missing and left at its default,
   the default of &lt;server_pool_max_free&gt; also changes and becomes 10.</p>

<p>Added a check on client's activity and heartbeats as a way to detect streaming
   connections kept open by some intermediate node while the client is stuck or
   already detached. The check has to be requested by the clients.</p>

<p><span class="notInAMS">Introduced an experimental support for external
   implementations of the PKCS#11 standard to be used as keystores. Contact
   Lightstreamer Support for details.<br/></span>
   Introduced the explicit support of keystores of type PKCS12, which, however,
   may not be available with old JDKs. The extension involves the
   &lt;keystore&gt; and &lt;truststore&gt; blocks under &lt;https_server&gt;
   and the &lt;keystore&gt; block under &lt;rmi_connector&gt;. Updated the
   included SSL Certificates.pdf document accordingly.<br/>
   Enforced the syntax checks on the mandatory subelements of the abovementioned
   blocks. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Only in case of
   illegal missing subelements, an existing configuration that used to be
   tolerated (by assuming an empty block) may now be refused on startup.</span></p>

<p>Limited the responses of the form "License not valid for this Client version",
   which were issued also in cases in which the client version was not correctly
   specified in the request (which, actually, could also be due to request
   corruption). These cases are now treated as normal syntax errors (which are
   notified in different ways depending on the client type).<br/>
   Relieved the above license notifications for all clients based on the
   Web and Node.js client SDKs,
   also for old versions. Instead of issuing an alert (Web) or a console log
   (Node.js), a suitable error code is now reported; where not available,
   the issue is notified as a syntax error.</p>

<p>Updated the included versions of some third-party libraries; also added a few more
   libraries and removed some. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
   As the new libraries have different names, make sure you have removed the previous
   version of the libraries upon upgrade. Moreover, if using a custom launch script,
   ensure that the new libraries are now referred.</span>
   In particular:</p><ul>
   <li>Updated the included version of the slf4j library from 1.7.21 to 1.7.25. This library
   can be accessed by custom code from Adapters configured for the "log_enabled" ClassLoader.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: no compatibility issues are expected,
   but see the slf4j changelog for any details.</span></li>
   <li>Updated the included version of the logback library from 1.1.7 to 1.2.3. This library
   governs the interpretation of the logging configuration file.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: no compatibility issues are expected,
   but this library has introduced a few minor non-backward-compatible changes; see the
   logback changelog for any details.</span></li>
   <span class="notInAMS"><li>Updated the included version of the janino library
   from 3.0.0 to 3.0.7. This library handles the interpretation of the trigger expressions
   in the MPN Module. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: no compatibility
   issues are expected, but only improvements in the supported syntax; but see the janino
   changelog for any details.</span></li></span>
   </ul>

<p>Added a heuristic detection of client requests that may be targeted to a different
   Server instance of a cluster and routed to the wrong instance. The information
   is made available in the log and to the most recent clients.</p>

<p>Introduced a preliminary test of the reachability of the RMI Connector for the JMX interface.
   In fact, without the test, the Server could start by leaving the RMI Connector not
   reachable even by the "stop" script when lanched from the same environment as the Server.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: if the RMI Connector were not reachable
   from the Server environment with the configured hostname, an existing working installation
   will now fail to start. To disable the test, see the new &lt;test_ports&gt; configuration
   flag under &lt;rmi_connector&gt;.</span><br/>
   Added a configurable timeout to cope with cases in which the establishment or the test
   of the RMI Connector could block and delay the Server startup. See the new
   &lt;test_timeout_millis&gt; configuration flag under &lt;rmi_connector&gt;.<br/>
   Improved the log of setup and connection to the RMI Connector.</p>

<div class="subsectionTitle">Fixes for Bugs and Defects</div>

<p>Modified the handling of the HTTP headers configured through the
   &lt;response_http_headers&gt; block. If the same header is reported multiple
   times, multiple header lines will be now produced, instead of a single line
   with comma-separated values.<br/>
   This fixes the handling of multiple occurrences of the Set-Cookie header,
   for which multiple occurrences are indeed legal, but a comma-separated
   format, overriding the general HTTP rule, is not.<br/>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: For any other HTTP header
   currently configured, no change is expected in the behavior of the user-agents,
   as the multiple-lines and the comma-separated forms are supposed to be
   equivalent. At the most, for some other non-standard HTTP header, we can
   expect an improvement.</span></p>

<p>Improved the robustness of the Internal Web Server and the Monitoring Dashboard.<br/>
   Fixed missing escaping in the Internal Web Server, which might have caused some
   requests on directories with unusual names to fail.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug affecting update dispatching, which could have been triggered
   by the combination of a very fast unsubscription-resubscription sequence and
   significant delays in internal update processing, possibly due to high load.
   The bug could have caused one or more updates for the previous subscription
   to be used in place of an equal number of updates for the new subscription.</p>
   
<p>Fixed a bug in the handling of session termination which, in case of a
   concurrent unsubscription, could have caused the corresponding notifyTablesClose
   invocation to be missed. As said, this could only occur upon session close,
   hence just before the final notifySessionClose notification.<br/>
   Fixed other harmless bugs in the handling of session termination which,
   in rare cases, could have caused an exception to be logged.</p>
   
<p>Fixed a bug which caused the Server response to be empty
   upon requests made with the recently introduced TLCP protocol and containing
   syntax errors. The response should have reported error code 65, 67, or 68.
   This could only affect clients based on the SDK for Generic Clients.</p>

<p>Fixed the handling of empty requests, which caused an exception to be thrown.</p>

<p>Ensured compatibility with Javascript strict mode for clients based on the
   Node.js Client SDK.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug triggered by reuse, by the Data Adapter, of an update event
   of HashMap type in multiple update/smartUpdate calls for different items,
   when the modes of the two items were different. In this case, some field values
   could have been treated as null and a WARN message could have been issued.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that, in rare and isolated cases, could have caused the average
   wait on a thread pool queue to be computed as a negative number.
   This affected the JMX Extension SDK (including
   the JMX Tree) and the internal MONITOR Data Adapter and log.</p>

<p>Ensured runtime compatibility with Java 9; this also required a change in the
   launch script, to use Java 9's JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS environment variable.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If an existing installation
   uses a custom launch script, it can be left unmodified; however, in order
   to take advantage of the improvement, the change should be ported.</span></p>

<p>Fixed the documentation comment of the &lt;server_tokens&gt; configuration
   element, as the Server identifies itself as "Lightstreamer Server" instead
   of "Lightstreamer" since version 6.0.</p>

<div class="subsectionTitle">Minor Changes and Extensions</div>

<p>Improved the communication with the embedded version of the Proxy Adapters.
   This will impact on the count of "active threads" involved in the invocations
   of notifyUser and notifyUserMessage, which should become much smaller.
   Nevertheless, the related "queued tasks" and "pool queue wait" statistics
   should remain similar, to still take into account the wait for the answers
   from the Remote Adapter. As a consequence, the behavior of the various
   "max_queue" configuration flags should also remain similar.</p>

<p>Added preliminary checks on the completeness of the configured keystores.
   If a keystore doesn't define a private key, the startup will fail.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing installations
   are not expected to configure an empty keystore, since, in this case,
   the port wouldn't accept any connection; however, the Server would start
   and other ports would still work. Now, to achieve the same, that port
   should be removed from the configuration.</span></p>

<p>Moved to case-sensitive checks for the recognition of the values set for
   the "classloader" parameters in adapters.xml. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Only existing configuration using non-lowercase values
   would be refused, but this case is not expected, as never explicitly allowed.
   </span></p>

<p>Introduced the &lt;handshake_timeout_millis&gt;
   configuration element to replace &lt;read_timeout_millis&gt; when TLS/SSL
   handshakes are involved. This also modifies the applied timeout,
   which is now 4000 ms, unless reconfigured.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If an existing installation
   needs to keep the TLS/SSL handshake timeout unchanged, a new
   &lt;handshake_timeout_millis&gt; element with the same value specified for
   &lt;read_timeout_millis&gt; has to be added.</span> <br/>
   Clarified when the various I/O timeout checks can be suppressed.</p>

<p>Modified the HTTP 404 response issued to WebSocket opening requests that
   specify a wrong URI. The page configured through &lt;error_page&gt;
   is now returned as the body.</p>

<p>Revised and improved the Monitoring Dashboard.<br/>
   Added the new tab "License" summarizing the details of your edition and the specific 
   license features active in the server running.<br/>
   Optimized the subscriptions handling for "Logs" tab in case of get/lost focus events.</p>

<p>Extended the internal MONITOR Data Adapter with new items, "monitor_details" and
   "monitor_client_libs", which provide details of your edition and the specific 
   license features active in the server running. Look for the new items in the
   General Concepts document for details.</p>

<p>Brought various efficiency improvements, to increase the scalability with respect,
   in particular, to the overall frequency of client control requests.<br/>
   The scenario of massive client disconnections has also been addressed.<br/>
   Reduced the allocation of short-lived memory for various tasks, which should
   save some Garbage Collection work.</p>

<p>Improved the checks associated to the &lt;unexpected_wait_threshold_millis&gt;
   setting, to embrace all invocations to the adapters.</p>

<p>Revised the handling and improved logging of http parsing issues.<br/>
   Improved the log of connection issues by adding socket information where missing.</p>

<p>Changed the suggested setting for the &lt;write_timeout_millis&gt; configuration
   element to enable the check, though with a long timeout, to cope with half-open
   connections.</p>

<p>Moved to case-sensitive checks for the recognition of the values set for
   the "classloader" parameters in adapters.xml. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Only existing configuration using non-lowercase values
   would be refused, but this case is not expected, as never explicitly allowed.
   </span></p>

<p>Extended the &lt;disable_session_mbeans&gt; configuration
   element; with the new "sampled_statistics_only" setting, these MBeans will still
   be available from the SDK for JMX Extensions, but the properties based
   on periodic sampling (which can cause scalability issues in some scenarios)
   will not be computed.</p>

<p>Introduced a size limit on the internal buffers that can be kept allocated for reuse.
   Only in particular cases, the overall allocation of these buffers could have grown
   too much and caused memory shortage.<br/> 
   Introduced the &lt;max_common_pump_buffer_allocation&gt; and
   &lt;max_common_nio_buffer_allocation&gt; configuration elements to manage the limit.</p>

<p>Addressed a compatibility issue with Safari which, when leveraging the newly introduced
   session recovery feature, could have caused unexpected exceptions in pages based on the
   Web Client SDK.</p>

<p>Revised the internal approximation in item frequency management. This avoids that,
   with very high requested frequencies, the "real" frequency may be higher.</p>

<p>Increased the length of the generated session IDs by a few bytes.</p>

<p>Improved the log of WebSocket requests, by adding the involved session id when it is
   omitted from the request.<br/>
   Introduced the "upd" sublogger to the LightstreamerLogger.subscriptions logger,
   to distinguish the part of log related with the events coming from the Data Adapter.
   By setting it to ERROR, the warnings issued upon updates for items currently not
   subscribed to can be suppressed.</p>

<p>Slightly revised the log on startup.</p>

<p>Improved the "stop" script to act faster.</p>

<div class="subsectionTitle">Documentation and Deployment Level Changes</div>

<p>Aligned the included SSL Certificates.pdf document to recent
   standards. In particular, suggested the inclusion of the "subject alternative name"
   field in the certificate, which may be required by some user agents.</p>

<p>Revised the Clustering.pdf document and aligned it to the current state
   of the client SDKs with regard to cookie handling requirements.
   Also reformulated the HTTPS section to consider acquisition of multi-domain
   certificates as the normal practice.</p>

<p>Revised naming convention and format of Audit logs.
   See files header in the "audit" folder for details.</p>

<p>Slightly revised the preinstalled welcome page. Added a new section with "Edition"
   details.</p>


<div class="version">6.1.0 build 1817</div>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 23 Jan 2017</div></span>

<p>Introduced the support for a new client protocol, named TLCP,
   with various improvements, that can be leveraged by client SDKs and by custom clients.
   See the SDK for Generic Clients for details.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug related with the content-length configuration. When a value higher than 2^31
   was configured for &lt;content_length&gt; or specified on the client side, it would be
   read wrongly and an internally determined lower bound of 10000 would be used instead.<br/>
   The same bug affected the &lt;max_streaming_millis&gt; setting; in that case,
   high values were interpreted as not limiting at all.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation for the "name" attribute of the &lt;http_server&gt;
   and &lt;https_server&gt; blocks, where the allowed
   character range was missing. The use of non ASCII or ASCII control characters could,
   in particular cases, have caused errors in the communication with the clients.<br/>
   Added a check on the configured names which now refuses disallowed characters.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If disallowed characters have
   been used, the configuration may have to be modified.</span></p>

<p>Fixed the documentation and the management of the
   &lt;control_link_address&gt; and &lt;control_link_machine_name&gt; configuration
   elements, where the use of non standard characters could, in particular cases,
   have caused errors in the communication with the clients.<br/>
   Unicode names are currently supported by the Web, Node.js, Java, and Android
   (Unified API) Client SDKs and by the Generic Client SDK. More will come.</p>

<p>Introduced a limited support for JVM property expansion in the interpretation
   of the adapters.xml files. It has to be enabled through a new configuration flag,
   &lt;enable_expansion_for_adapters_config&gt; in the main configuration file.
   The new factory configuration enables the feature. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: In existing installations the interpretation will not change,
   as the feature is disabled by default.</span></p>

<p>Improved the factory settings of the log configuration file, with regard to the
   display of the logger name by the preconfigured "LSDailyRolling" appender.
   The new "%-19.19c{19}" setting is recommended, because it causes Logback to shorten
   the "LightstreamerLogger" part of the names to "L", allowing for a reduced field,
   while preserving the other parts of the names. The previous setting was "%-33.33c"</p>

<p>Added the "private" property to the &lt;client_identification&gt; configuration element,
   to prevent sending the determined client address to the client, which is done by some
   of the Unified Client SDKs.</p>

<p>Clarified the description of the &lt;cross_domain_policy&gt; configuration block,
   for what concerns the origin checks on WebSockets.<br/>
   Clarified the description of the &lt;max_buffer_size&gt; configuration element,
   to cite the case of the snapshot for DISTINCT items.</p>

<p>Revised the error messages sent to the client. Improved the messages upon request
   syntax errors, for the benefit of tests with the Generic Client SDK. Used less
   specific messages on subscription errors, to avoid specifying item names.</p>

<p>Slightly modified the behavior upon unexpected request URLs. The configured error page
   will no longer be sent upon URLs related to features that are currently not supported
   or not enabled, but a HTTP 400 error will be issued instead.<br/>
   Modified the behavior upon syntactically wrong requests. A HTTP 400 error instead
   of a HTTP 500 error will now be issued.<br/>
   Revised the low-level WebSocket close code used, so as to report a non-successful
   close only when really needed.</p>

<p>Added a suggested configuration setting in the
   &lt;response_http_headers&gt; block, which may help to enable streaming support
   when proxies of several types are involved.</p>

<p>Revised internal optimizations on field value processing to focus on the most recent
   client SDK libraries.</p>

<p>Improved logging by LightstreamerLogger.requests.messages by adding message
   forwarding details at DEBUG level.<br/>
   Improved logging by LightstreamerLogger.subscriptions at DEBUG level, by handling
   the case of byte array values.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Incremented the minor version number.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running the Server with
   a license file, an upgrade of the license file is needed.</span></p>

<p>MPN Module: fixed handling of cases where a device tries to subscribe
   multiple times in a short period of time, possibly causing device duplication.<br/>
   Note: duplication is still possible if multiple subscriptions are sent on different
   client sessions connected to different Server instances at the same time. In this
   scenario the MPN Module tries to detect the spurious devices and deletes them
   automatically.</p>

<p>MPN Module: fixed handling of "InvalidPackageName" error code from
   the GCM (now Firebase Cloud Messaging) service. The device is now suspended, similarly to
   a "NotRegistered" error code.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Updated the included versions of some third-party libraries used
   by the MPN Module. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: As the new libraries have different names, make sure you have removed

<p>Fixed a bug in Mobile Push Notification module that resulted in payloads for APNs being
   rejected if longer than 256 bytes. Now payloads up to 2048 bytes are accepted, as expected.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in version 6.0, which could have caused incorrect, hence refused,
   responses to session requests by very old versions of Web Client SDK Library.
   However, the malfunctioning was only associated with the use of uncommon transports,
   usually needed only as fallbacks for old browsers.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced with version 6.0, which caused the "pool queue wait" statistics
   to be always reported as 0.
   This affected managers based on JMX Extension SDK
   (including the JMX Tree) and the Special MONITOR Data Adapter;
   the latter, in turn, affected the Monitoring log.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the implementation of the JMX Extension SDK,
   which caused the values for the AvgQueueWaitMillis and CurrQueueWaitMillis properties
   in the ThreadPool MBean to be switched.</p>

<p>Updated the included versions of some third-party libraries. <span class="compatibility">

<p>Fixed a bug in the management of clearSnapshot for items subscribed to in DISTINCT mode.
   The bug affected the first update after clearSnapshot and could cause some fields to be
   dispatched with wrong values. Specifically, let [B2,B1,CS,A1] be a sequence of events
   sent to a client (where CS is the ClearSnapshot): any field in A1 that was identical in B2
   but different in B1 would have been reported with the value it had in B1, hence wrongly.</p>

<p>Fixed a syntax error in the installation script for Linux, that was introduced
   in version 6.0.1 build 1778.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in version 4.0 and regarding encoding of custom error
   messages when sending them to clients based on Web and Node.js (Unified API) Client SDKs;
   such messages can be supplied through the exceptions thrown by notifyUser and notifyNewSession.
   The bug only affected messages which included double quotes and would cause the
   onServerError callback not to be invoked at all on the client JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Fixed an inefficiency in the processing of COMMAND mode snapshot introduced in version
   6.0 build 1737. The issue was noticeable only with snapshots of many thousands of keys.<br/>
   Removed the same kind of inefficiency also with regard to real-time updates.</p>

<p>Improved the handling of cross-origin requests (used by the Web (Unified API) Client SDK),
   by returning the appropriate headers also upon most error responses.</p>

<p>Revised the parsing of the various configuration files (including adapters.xml)
   to improve diagnostics. Some space characters are now ignored.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: No change is to be expected
   in the interpretation of correct configuration files.</span></p>

<p>Slightly revised the page supplied by the internal Web Server upon a 404 error,
   to also have IE and Edge display it rather than a custom page.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Enforced upload of audit logs by default when
   LICENSE_SERVER is configured in lightstreamer_version_conf.xml.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If the upload is undesirable
   or problematic for any reason, it can be suppressed with the subsequent
   &lt;automatic_audit_upload&gt; element.</span></p>

<p>Extended the factory settings for the &lt;remove_cipher_suites&gt; elements,
   to comply with the current common recommendations.</p>

<p>Clarified in the configuration file that the names chosen for the &lt;http_server&gt;
   and &lt;https_server&gt; blocks are available
   to the clients.</p>

<p>Realigned the launch script to suggest the use of java 8.</p>

<p>Put a reminder about JMX RMI connector credential setting in
   PRODUCTION_SECURITY_NOTES.TXT.</p>

<p>Updated the Client Library included in the Monitoring Dashboard to

<p>Fixed a bug triggered by thread pool settings of a 0 "max_size" (which means unlimited
   in this case) and a 0 "max_free", for pools which support these settings.
   The bug would cause a progressive and unlimited growth of the pool.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced with version 6.0, which caused the count of the total number
   of internal selectors to be always reported as 0.
   This affected managers based on JMX Extension SDK
   (including the JMX Tree) and the Special MONITOR Data Adapter; the latter,
   in turn, affected the Monitoring log and the Monitoring Dashboard.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which, in case of a massive disconnection of clients, could have caused
   some harmless error conditions on single connections to be reported and handled
   as serious errors affecting the whole NIO selector.</p>

<p>Extended the check of the &lt;read_timeout_millis&gt; setting in the case of
   TLS/SSL handshake operations. Now this delay limit is applied not only to read,
   as well as write, operations related to the handshake, but also to any queueing of
   elaboration tasks on the "TLS-SSL AUTHENTICATION" or "TLS-SSL HANDSHAKE" thread pool.
   <br/>Clarified in the log when a connection is closed due to the
   &lt;read_timeout_millis&gt; setting.</p>

<p>Updated the included versions of some third-party libraries. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: As the new libraries have different names, make sure you have removed
   the previous version of the libraries upon upgrade. Moreover, if using a custom launch script,
   ensure that the new libraries are now referred.</span></p>

<p>Extended the launch scripts to allow for the customization of the path of the main
   configuration file through an environment variable; before, a custom modification
   of the script was the only way to achieve that. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: The script now checks a variable named LS_CONFIG; in case the same
   name were currently used for a custom variable in the launching environment, this would
   rise a conflict.</span></p>

<p>Extended the launch script for unix/linux to clarify how to handle the case in which
   the file descriptor limit has to be manually supplied.</p>

<p>Extended the installation script for Redhat, so that the installed System V init script
   now supports the "status" option to determine the current status of Lightstreamer server.
   This enables the "status" command for the "service" utility.</p>

<p>Revised the internal handling of field values to improve the most common usage scenarios.
   This also extends the cases of early conversions of field values, hence extending
   the scope of the &lt;force_early_conversions&gt; configuration element.</p>

<p>Applied some performance improvements to cope with a huge number of concurrent
   requests for new sessions.</p>

<p>Reorganized the initial configuration phase; some log messages related to adapters
   and jmx initialization may have changed.</p>

<p>Slightly refactored the launch scripts, to simplify custom changes.</p>

<p>Applied some improvements to the Monitoring Dashboard layout. Changed the layout
   of the "JVM Memory Heap" chart.</p>

<p>Added some clarifications to the General Concepts document.</p>


<div class="version">6.0 build 1741</div>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="compatibility">Compatible with the database of the MPN Module for the previous version.</div></span>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 13 Feb 2015</div></span>

<p>Added an early check of the correctness of any trigger
   expressions configured, whose failure will prevent startup; before, all
   related notification deliveries would just fail.</p>

<p>Clarified in the Clustering document how to handle the case
   in which a Load Balancer discontinues the stickiness during a session and
   improved the internal handling of this case.<br/>
   Also clarified how a rebalancing can be enforced. Introduced, to this purpose,
   the &lt;max_session_duration_minutes&gt; configuration flag, to set a maximum
   duration for client sessions, after which a client has the opportunity
   to recover with a new session, and the Balancer has the opportunity to migrate
   the client to a different Server instance.</p>

<p>Fixed a wrong startup check which caused the startup
   to fail upon a missing &lt;reaction_on_database_failure&lt; flag also when
   the MPN Module was not enabled.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the computation of statistics on the
   MPN Module activity, used by the PushNotificationsMBean and the internal
   MONITOR Data Adapter and log. The values that represent averages over an
   interval were reported delayed, among the data for the subsequent interval.</p>

<p>Revised and improved the Monitoring Dashboard.<br/>
   Fixed a bug which caused wrong decimal parts to be displayed for the "total bytes"
   fields when more than 1GB was reported.<br/>
   Fixed a bug which caused a wrong value to be displayed in the "total heap" donut
   when more than 1GB was reported.<br/>
   Fixed the general behavior related to the case in which the Server was not reachable.
   In particular, when reconnecting after a temporary disconnection, the charts are
   now cleared to avoid confusion.<br/>
   Improved the usability in several other small aspects.</p>

<p>Improved the functionality of the preinstalled welcome page in several small
   aspects and fixed some browser compatibility issues. This also removes some
   possible harmless warning messages from the Server console.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in build 1737 which caused loss of compatibility
   with very old Metadata Adapter binaries (as IllegalArgumentException
   was thrown upon the invocation of methods with an old signature).</p>

<p>Fixed the determination of the SDK versions used by the clients, which was
   ignoring the subminor version number. This also affects the values reported
   by the JMX interface.</p>

<p>Extended the install script for MACOSX (now macOS) with suitable variables to customize
   the IDs if a new user and/or group has to be created.</p>

<p>Added a default configuration for loggers used by the included third-party
   "Apache Velocity" library.</p>

<p>Added identification tags at the beginning of various configuration files and
   launch scripts. By keeping them, future upgrades of these files may be automated.</p>

<p>Removed the main README file, but kept directives on how to upgrade in the new
   HOW_TO_UPGRADE.TXT file.</p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 21 Jan 2015</div></span>

<div class="subsectionTitle">Systemwide Changes and Extensions</div>

<p>Introduced a Push Notification Service (or MPN Module),
   which can be leveraged by the clients to have notifications sent to their
   devices, through an available third-party Push Notification Service, upon
   updates for subscribed items. Currently, only sending notifications
   through Apple's APNS and Google's GCM is supported
   and requesting subscriptions for such notifications is only supported by the
   iOS / OS X (now macOS) and the Android Client SDKs, respectively. See the new chapter 5
   in the General Concepts document for an introduction to the feature.<br/>
   Introduced several new thread pools for the MPN Module operations.
   The module also leans on an external database, which, in case of a cluster
   of Server instances, can be shared among all instances.
   See the new optional &lt;mpn&gt; configuration block for configuration details.
   The new optional &lt;max_mpn_devices&gt; element is also available, to set
   activity limits for protection.<br/>
   Introduced a suitable logger, "LightstreamerLogger.mpn", with several
   subloggers, for the MPN Module log (see the factory logging configuration
   file for details).
   When enabled, the MPN Module will also produce its own Audit Logs.<br/>
   <span class="notInAMS">Note that the feature may not be available, depending
   on the license terms. It is always available in the LICENSE_SERVER and DEMO
   cases, in the latter case with a limit of 20 devices served.</span>
   <span class="notInAPV">However, the MPN Module is not available with
   this edition.</span>
   <span class="notInAMS">New libraries have also been added under the "lib"
   directory for this extension. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If using a custom launch script,
   ensure that the new libraries are referred.<br/>Conflicts between the new
   libraries and existing Adapter code are no longer possible, because of the
   newly introduced ClassLoader separation.</span></span></p>

<p>Extended the provided MONITOR Data Adapter with statistics related
   with the newly introduced MPN Module. See the last paragraph of the General
   Concepts document and Look for the PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS.* fields for details.<br/>
   Extended the Internal Monitor log to include some of the new MPN Module
   statistics, but only when the module is enabled.<br/>
   The extension is also leveraged by the new Monitoring Dashboard.
   <span class="notInAPV">However, with the included license, all the new
   statistics will always hold a 0 value.</span>
   <span class="notInAPV">However, the MPN Module is not available with this
   edition, hence all the new statistics will always hold a 0 value.</span></p>

<p>Introduced the Monitoring Dashboard, which extends and replaces the Monitor
   Console. The new page has multiple tabs, which show the information available
   in the previous Monitor Console with significant visual improvements;
   moreover, the last tab shows the newly introduced JMX Tree, which exposes
   the JMX interface in web form.<br/>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: *** IMPORTANT *** The security
   level previously adopted for the access to the Monitor Console may no longer
   be adequate for the full Monitoring Dashboard, which enables
   data view and management, including
   the Server shutdown operation (note that the JMX Tree is enabled by factory
   settings). We recommend configuring the credentials
   and protecting them by making the Monitoring
   Dashboard only available on https server sockets,
   by leveraging the settings in the &lt;dashboard&gt; configuration block.
   See PRODUCTION_SECURITY_NOTES.TXT for a full check-list.</span>
   The Monitoring Dashboard can be reached through a different URL path,
   whose default is /dashboard. The path can be changed through the
   &lt;dashboard_url_path&gt; element under the &lt;dashboard&gt; block.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If keeping an existing
   installation where the Internal Web Server is leveraged, ensure that there
   are no conflicts with the new reserved path.</span>
   The extension is associated to several changes with respect to the previous
   configuration rules:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>The &lt;monitor_provider&gt; block has been discontinued, as replaced
   by the new mandatory &lt;dashboard&gt; block, which features a similar but
   extended content (see the configuration file for all details).
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing configuration files
   have to be ported. If the &lt;monitor_provider&gt; block element is present,
   the Server will refuse to start, in order to avoid confusion. Note that, by
   just renaming an existing &lt;monitor_provider&gt; block to &lt;dashboard&gt;,
   the accessibility of the Monitoring Dashboard will be configured in the same
   way as the old Monitor Console, with the new JMX Tree disabled.</span></li>
   <li>The &lt;monitor_enabled&gt; element under &lt;web_server&gt; has been
   dismissed; actually, it was available only to prevent (when "N") the Internal
   Web Server from considering the Monitor Console URL path as reserved;
   this is no longer allowed with the Monitoring Dashboard URL path.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If keeping an existing
   configuration file, the &lt;monitor_enabled&gt; element, if present, must
   be removed; otherwise the Server will refuse to start, in order to avoid
   confusion. Note that if the element had been set to "N", this was only
   hiding the Monitor Console page, not protecting the data: external access to
   monitoring data was supposed to be prevented through the &lt;monitor_provider&gt;
   block; the same protection should now be ensured through the &lt;dashboard&gt;
   block.</span></li>
   <li>The &lt;monitor_url_path&gt; element under &lt;web_server&gt; has been
   dismissed, as replaced by the aforementioned &lt;dashboard_url_path&gt;.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If keeping an existing
   configuration file, the &lt;monitor_url_path&gt; element, if present, must
   be removed; otherwise the Server will refuse to start, in order to avoid
   confusion.</span></li>
   <li>The dedicated "LightstreamerLogger.webServer.jmxTree" logger has been added.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>New libraries have also been added under the "lib" directory for this extension.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If using a custom launch script,
   ensure that the new libraries are referred.<br/>Conflicts between the new
   libraries and existing Adapter code are no longer possible, because of the
   newly introduced ClassLoader separation.</span></p>

<p>Removed the proprietary Sun/Oracle HTML adaptor to the
   JMX interface; now, web access to the JMX interface can be performed through
   the new Monitoring Dashboard, with the included JMX Tree.
   As a consequence, web access to JMX can now be performed through the normal
   listening ports, with no need for a dedicated port. This also allows for access
   through https, which was not available with the old HTML adaptor.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If there is a requirement
   to still rely on a dedicated port, perhaps with restricted firewall rules,
   for web access to JMX, then it is possible to setup a new server port through
   &lt;http_server&gt; or &lt;https_server&gt; and restrict the visibility of the
   JMX Tree to only this server port, through the settings in the &lt;dashboard&gt;
   block.</span>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Any credentials set to ensure
   restricted access to the HTML adaptor can be transferred to the Monitoring
   Dashboard, through the settings in the &lt;dashboard&gt; block. Note that the
   involved users will have access to the full Monitoring Dashboard features.</span>
   Removed the &lt;html_adaptor&gt; configuration section from the &lt;jmx&gt; block.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If keeping an existing configuration
   file, the &lt;html_adaptor&gt; block, if present, must be removed; otherwise the
   Server will refuse to start, in order to avoid confusion.</span></p>

<p>Introduced separate ClassLoaders for the loading of the external libraries used
   by the Server internally. This means that all these libraries are no longer visible
   from Adapter code and this should prevent the rise of any conflicts.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: No issues are expected, but see
   the SDK for Java In-Process Adapters changelog for the details. Should any
   problem arise, the previous behavior can also be restored, by changing the classpath
   setting in the Server launch script (see the inline comment for details).</span>
   As a consequence, added separate libraries in the "lib" directory, containing the
   custom helper classes needed for the log configuration and the minimal server
   startup code. Also moved most external libraries in dedicated subdirectories.
   The above has also required a thorough modification of the launch scripts.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: It is not possible to reuse
   a current installation of the previous 5.1.2 version and just overwrite the libraries;
   a fresh installation is needed and the new launch script has to be used. Any custom
   launch script should be revised.</span></p>

<p>Extended the log configuration to handle some of the included third-party libraries
   (see the factory logging configuration file for details).
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Conflicts with any configuration
   for the same libraries in existing Adapter code are no longer possible, because of the
   newly introduced ClassLoader separation.</span>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If reusing an existing configuration,
   the new loggers should be added; otherwise, some undesired log may be received
   from the newly included libraries.</span></p>

<p>Introduced the management of the Proxy Protocol, which allows a local reverse proxy
   or load balancer to provide information on the remote endpoint in a direct way.
   See the new configuration elements in the &lt;client_identification&gt; blocks
   for details, also about how the existing elements interact with the new ones.
   A dedicated logger, LightstreamerLogger.connections.proxy, has also been added.</p>

<p>Introduced the &lt;allow_protocol&gt; and &lt;remove_protocols&gt;
   configuration elements in the &lt;https_server&gt; to make it possible to restrict
   the protocol versions to be used in the TLS/SSL interactions.<br/>
   Introduced the same elements also in the &lt;rmi_connector&gt; block, to configure
   the JMX communication channel.</p>

<p>Changed the factory and recommended settings for TLS/SSL sockets,
   to remove weak protocols, by leveraging the new &lt;remove_protocols&gt; configuration
   elements. This may cause some clients to no longer be able to connect; in this case,
   the added configuration can be modified.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: As the change only involves the
   factory configuration file, if an existing configuration is kept, it will not
   be affected by the restriction. However, we recommend manually applying the same
   restriction to these installations as well.</span></p>

<p class="notInAMS">Incremented the major version number.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running the Server with
   a license file, an upgrade is needed.</span></p>

<div class="subsectionTitle">Fixes for Bugs and Defects</div>

<p>Fixed a bug on the management of sendMessage requests for which a sequence
   is specified; the bug could have caused some messages to be wrongly considered
   as duplicated, hence discarded, due to a race condition.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the internal detection of connection close causes, which could give rise
   to cause code notifications of 43 (failure) upon some cases of normal close.</p>

<p>Fixed the "stop" scripts, to take the &lt;hostname&gt;
   specified for the JMX RMI connector or the "java.rmi.server.hostname"
   property into account, as the Server does.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which caused the "stop" scripts to fail when the Server was still
   blocked in the startup phase, typically while waiting for the initialization
   of some Adapter.</p>

<p>Improved the launch scripts to enforce, by default, a maximum pause setting
   for the GC. This fixes cases in which the default settings could allow for
   pauses incompatible with the default timeouts used by the various Client SDKs
   in socket inactivity checks.</p>

<p>Fixed a memory leak triggered by exceptions thrown by the Metadata Adapter
   upon notifyNewTables, which also caused the subscription attempt to never be
   retried until reissued by the client application.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the initialization phase, which could have caused the generation
   of more threads and NIO selectors than configured. These spurious resources
   wouldn't have been used by the Server, so they would have been just redundant.<p>

<p>Fixed a missing case in which the error page (customizable through the &lt;error_page&gt;
   configuration element) should have been issued instead of a generic response.</p>

<p>Fixed the install script provided in bin\unix-like\install for the Redhat case,
   which wouldn't have run correctly if the default installation user had been left.<br/>
   Changed the install script for the openSUSE case, to also force run-at-startup,
   as for all other scripts.<br/>
   Fixed the install script for the MACOSX (now macOS) case, which would have generated a wrong
   launch script; also revised the way it creates the dedicated user.</p>

<p>Improved the policy for the speculative sizing of the TCP buffers. Fixed cases in which
   the resizing was inappropriate.<br/>
   Improved the management of internal buffers; this should reduce the use of short-lived memory
   for high numbers of sessions, particularly when &lt;reuse_pump_buffers&gt; is set to N.<br/>
   Fixed missing cases of buffer optimization when &lt;reuse_pump_buffers&gt; is set to N;
   this significantly improves the scalability in terms of concurrent TLS/SSL connections.</p>

<p>Improved parsing of HTTP requests for the internal Web Server, to limit the cases
   of unrecognized requests.</p>

<p>Extended the scope of the &lt;server_tokens&gt; configuration element to all aspects
   of the interaction with the clients. This fixes a few rare cases in which further
   identification information could be sent also when "MINIMAL" was specified.</p>

<p>Fixed a harmless bug which could have caused redundant logs of lost updates.</p>

<div class="subsectionTitle">Minor Changes and Extensions</div>

<p>Improved the support for request pipelining upon responses in HTTP 1.1,
   to deal with the case of pipelined requests occurring during streaming
   or long polling responses.

<p>Improved the management of items requested in COMMAND
   mode with unfiltered dispatching: unless &lt;preserve_unfiltered_command_ordering&gt;
   is Y, a round-robin policy is enforced among the keys on updates waiting to be sent.
   This should prove to be beneficial when no license-related frequency
   restrictions are in place.</p>

<p>Changed from N to Y the default of the
   &lt;disable_session_mbeans&gt; configuration flag, so that the related,
   potentially high, overhead will not affect JMX clients and the Server,
   unless explicitly requested. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
   If keeping an existing configuration file with this element not defined
   and taking advantage of the JMX interface and the Session MBeans,
   &lt;disable_session_mbeans&gt; should be explicitly set to N.</span></p>

<p>Improved the check related with the &lt;server_pool_max_queue&gt; setting.
   Now, if optional pools are configured in adapters.xml to absorb specific subsets
   of tasks from the SERVER pool, their task queues are included in the count under check.</p>

<p>Changed the default configuration when installing the Server as a service on
   Windows: NSSM is now configured not to relaunch the Server in case of failure.
   If needed, you may configure the service to restart in case of failure by
   changing the 'Recovery' property of the service. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Obviously, if the Server is currently installed as
   a service, it can be updated without being affected by this change; the
   change will take place only on the next installation.</span>
   Improved the support for the installation of the Server as a service under
   Windows; now it is possible to configure the display name, the description
   and the startup type. See "README.TXT" under "bin/windows" for details.<br/>
   Improved the LS.bat script by returning, in turn, the exit code returned by
   Lightstreamer server; the error code is useful if Lightstreamer Server
   is installed as a service and NSSM is configured not to relaunch the Server,
   to let Windows correctly manage the service restart.</p>

<p>Removed the log4j jar from the "shared" folder. It was there only for the benefit
   of the preinstalled demos. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If there were custom Adapters relying on the predeployed
   log4j jar, they could be ported in the new structure only by copying the log4j
   jar too; preferably, the jar should be put in the Adapters own folders.</span></p>

<p>Updated the included versions of some third-party libraries.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: As the new libraries have different
   names, ensure that the previous version of the libraries is removed. Moreover,
   if using a custom launch script, ensure that the new libraries are now referred.<br/>
   Conflicts between the new libraries and existing Adapter code are no longer possible,
   because of the newly introduced ClassLoader separation.</span></p>

<p>Improved the implementation of internal timers; this may reduce memory footprint
   when strong update merging/filtering is involved.</p>

<p>Modified the default setting of the &lt;selector_max_load&gt; configuration element
   for the Windows case; previously, it had a dedicated value of 1000 to overcome a known
   JDK 5 NIO bug; however, the currently supported JDK versions are unaffected.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If leaning on the default setting,
   the change should just cause a visible reduction in thread usage. Note that very old
   versions of JDK 6 for Windows are affected by another NIO bug (2177606) and a higher
   load on the selectors might, in principle, trigger it.</span></p>

<p>Added the &lt;snapshot_pool_size&gt; configuration element; now there is full
   control on the number of threads allocated for all the various internal pools.<br/>
   Added the &lt;selector_pool_size&gt; configuration element, which allows some control
   on the overall number of NIO selectors and related threads used by the Server.<br/>
   Added the &lt;timer_pool_size&gt; configuration element, which allows for
   parallelization of internal timer activity.</p>

<p>Extended the supplied "MONITOR" Data Adapter by adding a "TIME_MS" field,
   carrying a UTC timestamp, in all monitor_log_* items.<br/>
   Extended the supplied "MONITOR" Data Adapter with new statistics on the overall
   number of item subscriptions performed by the Clients. Look for CLIENT.ITEM_SUBSCR
   and CLIENT.MAX_ITEM_SUBSCR on the General Concepts document for details.<br/>
   Extended the Internal Monitor log to include the actual number of item subscriptions.
   The new statistics is also reported by the new Monitoring Dashboard.</p>

<p>Improved the handling of unexpected empty elements in the "adapters.xml" files.</p>

<p>Moved the activity log of the send_message requests to a suitable sublogger
   (namely LightstreamerLogger.requests.messages), which allows for easy removal
   of this log, if overwhelming.</p>

<p>Adjusted the Server's self-identification in answers to clients.<br/>
   Revised the format of error pages.</p>

<p>Revised the names of some internal thread pools.</p>

<p>Improved logging of closed connection and sessions with details on the connection
   close cause.</p>

<p>Improved logging of new sessions with information on the type and version
   of the involved client library, when available.</p>

<p>Introduced the "accept_extra_headers" and "accept_credentials" properties to the
   &lt;cross_domain_policy&gt; configuration element: if specified they respectively
   allow the clients to send extra headers and credentials on CORS requests.
   See description in the configuration file for details.</p>

<p>Optimized memory usage related to item and field names.</p>

<p>Introduced support for the WebPositive web browser.</p>

<div class="subsectionTitle">Documentation and Deployment Level Changes</div>

<p>Clarified in the "SSL Certificates" document how to
   cope with incomplete certificate chains received.</p>

<p>Revised the Clustering.pdf document, to clarify the conditions for the support of
   WebSockets by the Load Balancer.<br/>
   Simplified the document by removing notes pertaining to the support of old browsers;
   added references into the JavaScript SDK documentation for notes on special cases.</p>

<p>Revised and improved the "General Concepts" document, also with the addition
   of a thorough introductory section.</p>

<p>Added clarifications on when the &lt;enabled&gt; configuration element within
   &lt;websocket&gt; can be leveraged to cope with a Load Balancer not handling
   WebSockets correctly.</p>

<p>Wholly revised the preinstalled welcome page and the related demos.
   Now, the preinstalled resources are no longer meant as a deployment example
   that can be used as a starting point for creating your own POC. See the new
   "demos" site at demos.lightstreamer.com for all the available examples.</p>


<div class="version">5.1.2 build 1623.14</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with the deployment structure of the previous version.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with configuration files for the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 22 Jul 2014</div></span>

<p>Modified the policy for the active session count to be reported
   in the generated audit logs: sessions will no longer be considered as long as they are
   in "prestarted" state (see CLIENTS.SESSIONS in paragraph 4.2.1 of the General Concepts
   document for details). <span class="notInAMS">This may give rise to lower averages in
   the audits, which may actually be seen as a relief of contractual terms.</span>
   In fact, prestarted sessions may include sessions that have not been completely
   established because of communication issues, but (perhaps for the same cause)
   are being kept open for some time.</p>

<p>Improved the internal dispatching of NIO tasks; this may remove bottlenecks
   in extreme cases.<br/> Improved the internal mechanism of I/O buffer reusal;
   this may remove bottlenecks in extreme cases.</p>

<p>Introduced the possibility of customizing the page to be returned upon a "404 Not Found"
   response, through the &lt;notfound_page&gt; configuration element in &lt;web_server&gt;.
   Note that the 404 response is not used normally, but only when the Internal Web Server
   is enabled.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced with version 5.0, by which the &lt;delta_delivery&gt;
   configuration setting was ignored and delta delivery was always applied.
   Note that applying delta delivery is the normal case.</p>

<p>Introduced the &lt;use_enriched_content_type&gt; configuration
   element; now it possible to choose between two options, text/plain and text/enriched,
   the content-type to be specified in the response headers when handling requests issued
   using the text output protocol.<br/>
   By default, text/plain is still used, but the factory configuration supplied specifies
   the text/enriched content-type. This has some consequences on the Generic Client SDK;
   see the related changelog.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the internal statistics, which, under high load, might have caused
   spurious logs of the form "Current delay for tasks..." with very high delay.</p>

<p>Fixed a race condition that, in rare cases, could have caused a session not to be
   removed from the statistics when closed.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that could have caused a startup error if the "max_free" setting
   of some thread pool had been configured as 0.</p>

<p>Improved the internal implementation of some thread pools.<br/>
   Revised the internal timers to reduce thread contentions; this should reduce
   potential bottlenecks under very high load.</p>

<p>Tested the compatibility with the new Java 8 release.</p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Dec 2013</div></span>

<p>Changed the factory and recommended settings for TLS/SSL sockets,
   to remove weak cipher suites. This may cause some clients to no longer
   be able to connect; in this case, the &lt;remove_cipher_suites&gt;
   configuration elements should be modified. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: The change only involves the configuration file;
   if an existing configuration is kept, the Server upgrade will have no effect,

<p>Fixed the restart.sh launch script, which could have failed to stop the running Server
   for particular choices of the custom JVM arguments. Also clarified the script use case.</p>

<p>Improved the launch scripts and the installation scripts for the unix/linux environments
   in order to support the use of unusual names for the installation directory, such as names
   including spaces.<br/>
   Revised the installation scripts for the unix/linux environments to better handle the case
   in which the standard DESTDIR environment variable is not supplied (see the details in
   bin/unix-like/install/README.TXT). <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
   If using the supplied scripts in order to reinstall the Server, just make sure again that
   the scripts are compliant with your environment.</span>
   Addressed a possible incompatibility issue on the installation script for MacOSX (now macOS).</p>

<p>Extended the "Clustering.pdf" document, to clarify the conditions
   for the availability of WebSocket connections when a Load Balancer is in place.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on unfiltered subscriptions in COMMAND mode, whereby an ADD immediately following
   a DELETE on the same key could have been delayed until the next event on that key.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which affected the log of "create_session" requests, by stripping the first and

<p>Improved and optimized the allocation and parsing of client requests.
   Particularly improved the efficiency in the handling of SendMessage requests
   over WebSocket.</p>

<p>Extended the provided MONITOR Data Adapter with new statistics on the elaboration of Client
   Messages, sent through the SendMessage requests. Look for MESSAGE.* on the General Concepts
   document for details.<br/>
   Extended the Internal Monitor log to include some of the aforementioned
   message-related statistics.<br/>
   Extended the Monitor Console to display some of the aforementioned
   message-related statistics.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Introduced the automatic audit log upload service,
   to be leveraged based on the current license terms; for details, see also the newly
   added &lt;automatic_audit_upload&gt; configuration element in lightstreamer_version_conf.xml.
   To this purpose, the pubkey.cer file has been added to the "lib" directory.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the HTTP header parsing, that could have caused particular cases of headers
   lying on multiple lines to be parsed incorrectly.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the WebSocket handshake that could have caused the websocket establishment
   to be delayed on some browsers.<br/>
   Fixed a bug on WebSocket closure that might have caused a closure handshake to fail.<p>

<p>Fixed the notification of trial license expiration,
   corrupted in build 1513.1.11.</p>

<p>Fixed the reporting of syntax errors in the configuration file,
   which caused further errors.</p>

<p>Fixed the installation script for Redhat, which caused the Server to always run as root,
   regardless of the user configured.<br/>
   Fixed a typo in the console output of the launch script.</p>

<p>Improved the compatibility with the Android browser for Android version 4.x;
   this may also fix connection issues on some devices.</p>

<p>Deprecated the &lt;base_url_path&gt; configuration flag, which was only leveraged by the
   SDK for HTML Clients, but it is no longer leveraged by the new SDK for JavaScript Clients.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If the existing configuration uses
   this flag, it can be left unchanged and the flag will be still obeyed. However, the
   support may be discontinued in future releases.</span></p>

<p>Finally removed the support for the old-style configuration of the listening ports,
   not based on the &lt;http_server&gt; and &lt;https_server&gt; blocks. Also removed
   the support for the obsolete configuration element &lt;redundant_delivery&gt;.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing configurations still using
   the old elements have to be updated.</span></p>

<p>Made the &lt;server_pool_max_free&gt; configuration flag to be mandatory when
   &lt;server_pool_max_size&gt; is set to 0, since the previous default as also 0 was not suitable.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing configurations leaning on the
   mentioned default have to be completed, otherwise the Server startup will fail.</span></p>

<p>Revised the format of the log messages. Revised the log messages
   upon syntax errors in client requests (only possible with clients based on the
   SDK for Generic Clients).
   Slightly revised the format of the lines produced by the Internal Monitor log, to improve
   readability.</p>

<p>Added in the Clustering.pdf document notes on how to enable
   cookie-based stickiness for non-browser clients.</p>

<p>Put minor changes to the sample StockListDemo Adapter.</p>

<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with configuration files for the previous version;

<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with clients written for very old versions;
   see the compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 3 Aug 2012</div></span>

<p>Introduced support for requests through the WebSocket protocol; the supported versions of the
    WebSocket specifications are 8 and 13.
    Client libraries can now open a single WebSocket to send all requests and messages and to receive
    all data pertaining to a session. At the moment, this feature has been exploited by the JavaScript
    Client Library.<br/>
    The support is enabled by default; see the new &lt;websocket&gt; element in the configuration
    file.<br/>
    A public specification of a network protocol based on WebSockets for custom clients is not
    available yet.</p>

<p>Introduced support to cross-origin requests. See the new mandatory &lt;cross_domain_policy&gt;
    element in the server configuration file for further details. <span class="compatibility">
    COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Current configuration files must be extended with
    the &lt;cross_domain_policy&gt; element;
    as long as an old HTML Client SDK is used, the element can be left empty.</span>
    <br/>Note that the new JavaScript Client Library, on most browsers, uses cross-origin XHR or
    WebSocket requests to ask for streaming data; hence, the new &lt;cross_domain_policy&gt;
    element should be set properly and allow your site origin, in order to ensure that web pages
    supplied from your site can access the Server.
    <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: The above also holds for the Internal Monitor
    Console, though the page origin, in that case, is the Server itself, so that a same-origin
    access is performed; though most browsers don't need that, the Server origin should be
    explicitly allowed in &lt;cross_domain_policy&gt; in order to ensure that the Monitor Console
    keeps working on all browsers; see the Client Guide in the JavaScript SDK for details.</span>
    The factory setting of &lt;cross_domain_policy&gt; allows any kind of cross-origin access to
    the Server; note that this kind of access was not even possible with the previous HTML Client
    Library.</p>

<p>Disabled the forwarding of request cookies to some Metadata Adapter methods. As a consequence,
    the new factory setting of &lt;use_protected_js&gt; is now N, which is recommended in order
    to enable cross-origin access for some browsers which don't support cross-origin XHR
    (see the Client Guide in the JavaScript SDK for details).<br/>
    Introduced the &lt;forward_cookies&gt; configuration element (which defaults as N) to reenable
    forwarding when needed.
    <span class="compatibility"> COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Only if cookie information is used by
    Metadata Adapter methods, &lt;forward_cookies&gt; should be set as Y. However, if cookie
    information were used for authentication purpose (which is to be avoided, though),
    &lt;use_protected_js&gt; should be left as Y and &lt;cross_domain_policy&gt; should be set
    carefully.</span></p>

<p>Revised the licensing configuration, with the introduction
   of the new "lightstreamer_version_conf.xml" configuration file and the new mandatory
   &lt;version_conf&gt; configuration element in the main configuration file. See the inline
   comments in the factory configuration files for details.
   <span class="notInAMS">The &lt;trial&gt; and &ltproduction&gt; blocks in the main
   configuration file have been dismissed.</span>
   <span class="notInAPV">The &ltproduction&gt; block in the main configuration file
   has been dismissed.</span>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: In order to keep using an existing
   configuration file, it must be ported
   <span class="notInAMS">; for the &ltproduction&gt; block, refer to the "LICENSE_FILE"
   license type; for the &lt;trial&gt; block, refer to the "LICENSE_SERVER" license type
   and to the &lt;http_proxy&gt; block (note that the other parts of the &lt;proxy&gt;
   block are not available for trial license configuration).</span>
   <span class="notInAPV">to the new conventions.</span></p>

<p class="notInAMS">Introduced the "DEMO" license type, which is not based on a license key
   or trial account. See &lt;type&gt; in the new "lightstreamer_version_conf.xml"
   configuration file for details.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Introduced the generation of audit log files when trial accounts are in use.<br/>
   Discontinued the generation of audit logs for any other non-production licenses.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Provided an automatic update check service. See &lt;automatic_update_check&gt;
   in the new "lightstreamer_version_conf.xml" configuration file for details. Note that a proper
   proxy configuration, through the &lt;proxy&gt; block, may be needed.<br/>
   New libraries have been added to the "lib" directory for this extension.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If any existing Adapter were based
   on a different version of one of the libraries in "lib", conflicts may arise.</span></p>

<p>Changed the names returned by the "MONITOR" Data Adapter for the "LICENSE_TYPE" field,
   according to the new licensing policy.</p>

<p>Discontinued the support for java 5 SDK and runtime environment.
    Java 6 or later is now required.
    <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: installations of the Server still based
    on a java 5 JVM have to be upgraded. Existing Adapters compiled with a java 5 SDK
    don't need to be upgraded.</span>
    Revised the suggested JVM configuration in the launch scripts.</p>

<p>Improved the launch scripts for Windows and major Linux and Unix-like Operating Systems,
    supplied under the "bin" folder.
    As a consequence, manually setting the LS_HOME variable is no longer requested.<br/>
    Provided suitable scripts to install the Server for automatic execution in many Unix
    and Linux environments, including MAC OS X (now macOS); see "install" under "bin/unix-like".</p>

<p>Updated the included version of the third-party slf4j and logback libraries.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: As the new libraries have different names,
   ensure that the previous version
   of the libraries is removed. Moreover, if using a custom launch script, ensure that the new
   libraries are now referred.</span> <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing
   java Adapter binaries leaning on the included support for slf4j/logback should not be affected
   (but see the slf4j/logback release notes).</span>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: In case further slf4j/logback libraries
   are needed by the adapters, ensure that their versions
   are consistent with the new libraries included.</span></p>

<p><span class="notInAMS">Removed the third-party JUG libraries. </span>Removed the
   "lib/native" directory and any reference to it in the launch script.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing launch scripts will still work;
   any included reference to the "lib/native" directory will be useless.</span>
   Added more third-party libraries to support the new update check service.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing launch scripts should be extended
   to include the new libraries in the "lib" directory in the classpath.</span>
   Simplified the factory
   launch script in order to do a bulk add of the third-party libraries to the classpath.</p>

<p>Revised the implementation of the scripts that stop a running Server.
   They are now based on the RMI connector to the JMX service.
   As a consequence, the requirement
   for the script to work is that the &lt;rmi_connector&gt; block is properly configured,
   no longer the &lt;jmxmp_connector&gt; block. If the JMXMP connector is not used directly,
   it can be disabled.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If an existing configuration disables the
   RMI connector, it should enable it, possibly exposing the port to local connections only,
   in order to restore the "stop" script functionality.</span></p>

<p>Removed the third-party Oracle's jmxtools.jar and jmxremote_optional.jar
   libraries, previously redistributed.
   This drops the support for the HTML Adaptor and JMXMP
   Connector to the JMX service. The support can be restored by manually downloading and
   reinstalling the libraries. See README.TXT in the SDK for JMX Extensions for details.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If just upgrading an existing deployment,
   the aforementioned libraries should be manually removed. On the other hand, if the current
   deployment leans on the HTML Adaptor or the JMXMP Connector, the needed libraries must be
   obtained from Oracle as shown.</span>
   Removed the factory preconfiguration of the HTML Adaptor and JMXMP Connector.</p>

<p>Introduced a distinction between "prestarted" and started sessions; see CLIENTS.SESSIONS
   in paragraph 4.2.1 of the General Concepts document for details. Prestarted sessions
   are not included in the session count as far as Server activity metrics are concerned.<br/>
   Starting a prestarted session may fail if it would cause any existing limit on the
   number of sessions to be exceeded.</p>

<p>Introduced the optional &lt;client_identification&gt; configuration block, in order to help
   to better identify the remote address of the connected clients. The block is related to each
   single &lt;http_server&gt; or &lt;https_server&gt; block. See the configuration file for
   details.</p>

<p>Changed the factory setting of &lt;max_delay_millis&gt; from 200 to 30 ms
   (setting &lt;max_delay_millis&gt; may improve performances at the expense of a less smooth
   data delivery).
   The new, less restrictive, value is suitable for applications
   in which push data is used to map
   moving positions, provided that no edition-related frequency limits apply.</p>

<p>Improved the support for TLS/SSL renegotiation
    requests by the clients.<br/>
    Introduced dedicated thread pools to handle the load related with TLS/SSL handshakes;
    see &lt;handshake_pool_size&gt; and &lt;https_auth_pool_max_*&gt;
    in the configuration file.</p>

<p>Introduced configuration settings to suspend acceptance of new connection requests
    when the thread pools devoted to request handling are busy; see &lt;*_pool_max_queue&gt;.<p>

<p>Improved the implementation of the temporary refusal of new client
    connections that can be requested through JMX (see the Server MBean). In case of an HTTPS
    connection, the refusal now occurs before the initial handshake takes place.</p>

<p>Fixed a compatibility issue with Html Client Library version 5, which could have caused
   error messages related to session creation refusal to be ignored by the library.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in build 1513, which prevented the clean closure
   of TLS/SSL connections. This shouldn't have had any impact on normal operation.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which could have caused some connections in long polling to return
   unnecessarily early, with no data.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which would have provoked an error in the internal Web Server when sending
    an empty file, if the compression_threshold had been set to 0.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which could have caused the processing of "remote logs" sent by the HTML Client
    Library to fail for unusual user-agents.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the management of logback's own log, whereby the log related to
   logback initialization issues were not dumped. Now, it is available on the error console;
   the log is shown only in case of errors and in that case it is in verbose form.<br/>
   Introduced a custom Logback StatusListener implementation
   (OnConsoleErrorWarningStatusListener). Such StatusListener is now configured by default
   and will show on the standard error any internal ERROR or WARN event from Logback
   internal status.</p>

<p>Discontinued the support for the old syntax of the JMX configuration.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: if any of the &lt;html_adaptor_port&gt;,
   &lt;html_adaptor_public&gt;, &lt;html_adaptor_user&gt;, &lt;rmi_connector_port&gt;,
   &lt;jmxmp_connector_port&gt; is still used in the configuration file, it should be rewritten
   with the current syntax.</span></p>

<p>Reduced the response overhead on polling requests issued by the Javascript Client Library.</p>

<p>Extended the format of the audit logs with a random identifier of the
   Server run. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: existing and new audit log lines
   can coexist with no problems.</span></p>

<p>Ensured that, for each type of monitor statistics, the same value is collected by the various
   consumers for each time period; consumers include the monitor log, Monitor Console and any
   "MONITOR" Data Adapters.</p>

<p>Extended the logging of client activities, by adding information on the server socket
   (i.e. &lt;http_server&gt; or &lt;https_server&gt; block) related to the connection.</p>

<p>Revised various error log messages.<br/>
   Moved some harmless "Sync error" log messages from INFO to DEBUG level.<br/>
   Expanded and clarified info log messages about session closing.</p>

<p>Discontinued support for the LS_top_max_frequency and LS_slowing_factor request parameters.
    Such parameters had already been dismissed in the client protocol and all client libraries.
    <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: only clients based on a very old version
    of the client protocol or a client library might make use of these features. For them,
    the settings will no longer have any effect.</span></p>

<p>Slightly changed the response content-types for requests by the HTML/JavaScript Client Library;
    this may give rise to compatibility issues only for Opera browsers earlier than version 10.</p>

<p>Improved the performances under heavy load and under spikes of external requests,
    by reducing internal thread contention.</p>

<p>Changed the Connection counts
    returned by the internal MONITOR Data Adapter and the
    related log, to include sockets currently involved in the initial TLS/SSL handshake.<br/>
    Similarly, moved the log of accepted connections in https, to be issued immediately,
    before the initial TLS/SSL handshake, rather than after.</p>

<p>Improved the parsing of incoming HTTP requests, to make syntax checks more strict.</p>

<p>Denied support for specifying a network interface
    for the JMX RMI connector when the &lt;data_port&gt; setting is omitted,
    as this configuration is in fact not working properly.
    <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: we assume that no existing
    installation could be configured in this way, as it wouldn't have worked correctly;
    anyway, in such a case, only a warning message will be issued.</span>
    Fixed a bug which, with the above configuration, would have caused a port conflict
    error message to be issued.</p>

<p>Introduced the stdout/stderr redirection when launching the Server as a service
   under Windows. The LS.out file in the predefined logs directory is now generated.</p>

<p>Revised the layout of the Internal Monitor Console and fixed a formatting issue.</p>

<p>Updated the Clustering.pdf document, according with the new features added
   in the JavaScript SDK.</p>

<p>Fixed the jars of the included StockList demo: LS_StockListDemo_DataAdapter.jar also
   included the classes already in LS_quote_feed_simulator.jar.</p>

<p>Revised the documentation, in regard to the names of the main concepts.</p>

<p>Fixed the handling of uncommon pathnames in the utility scripts for using the Server
   as a service under Windows.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Fixed the documentation of the &lt;license_path&gt; configuration element
   with the extensions introduced in build 1513.1.4</p>

<p>Enlarged the "SNAPSHOT" thread pool (devoted to dispatching of snapshot contents)
   so as to match the number of available processors, if greater than 10.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in version 3.6, which affected subscriptions by the HTML Client Library
    to items in MERGE mode in case their snapshots was also requested; the update representing
    the snapshot could have been notified as not being a snapshot by the library.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the RelativeFileAppenders$RollingFileAppender implementation:
    the &lt;FileNamePattern&gt; specified in the &lt;rollingPolicy&gt; was interpreted
    relative to the launch directory instead of being
    interpreted relative to the log configuration file location, as it should have been.
    Now the paths specified in the &lt;FileNamePattern&gt; elements are correctly interpreted.
    On the other hand note that the &lt;File&gt; element was already correctly interpreted
    and thus its handling has not changed.</p>

<p>Introduced the support for dinamically reconfiguring the maximum frequency of currently
   subscribed items, that can be leveraged by client libraries.</p>

<p>Introduced the optional "randomize" attribute for both the &lt;default_keepalive_millis&gt;
   and &lt;max_idle_millis&gt; configuration elements, that can be used in particular
   scenarios; see the descriptions in the configuration file.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the handling of the &lt;allowed_domain&gt; setting, by which the check
   could have been avoided by purposedly altering the Html Client Library.</p>

<p>Clarified how resampling works for the LightstreamerMonitorText and LightstreamerMonitorTAB
   loggers configuration.</p>

<p>Adopted java 7 as the recommended SDK runtime environment and as the factory setting
   in the launch scripts.</p>

<p>Added the &lt;max_streaming_millis&gt; configuration flag; see the configuration file
   for details.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in version 4.0, affecting polling sessions; under particular
    conditions of slowness, poll requests could have returned immediately even with no data
    available, thus causing an unneeded increase of the overall frequency of requests.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug affecting polling sessions; under particular conditions of fastness, poll
    requests could have returned with no data even if data were available, thus causing
    data delivery to be delayed.</p>

<p>Fixed the supplied scripts for running the Server as a Windows service, which,
    under some conditions, could have failed to correctly install the service.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in version 4.0 which could have caused an html client to receive
    wrong data in case of issues with the use of XHR during a polling session. The error
    was serious, but the triggering environmental conditions were very rare.</p>

<p>Fixed a potential race condition which could have led to an internal thread deadlock.
    A high rate of socket disconnections (about 100 per second) was the only triggering
    scenario observed.</p>

<p>Changed, from 6666 to 6600, the factory setting for the port to be used
    for accessing the HTML-based JMX interface; in fact, access to port 6666 could be restricted
    by some browsers because of conflicts with known protocols.</p>

<p>Added missing documentation notes in the provided inline "MBeanInfo" descriptions,
   to align with the static docs.<br/>
   Improved the "see" references in the "MBeanInfo" descriptions (but they still
   lean on the javadoc-style naming convention adopted for the static docs).</p>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with custom managers for the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 28 Feb 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed the MaxVersionsAllowed property of the EditionDetailsMBean in case of DEMO license.</p>

<p>Added information about the new watchOS SDK to the EditionDetailsMBean.</p>

<p>Aligned the documentation to comply with current licensing policies.</p>


<div class="version">5.4.1 build 1851</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with custom managers for the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Dec 2017</div></span>

<p>Added a Data Adapter MBean for the new internal Data Adapter introduced for the
   MPN Module (when enabled). Note that, even though the Data Adapter is
   automatically added to all Adapter Sets, it is a single one and its MBean requires
   a special query for the access; see the Data Adapter MBean docs for details.
   On the other hand, it is not reported in any Adapter Set MBean.</p>

<p>Added the SampledStatisticsEnabled read-only property to the SessionMBeans,
   to reflect the new "sampled_statistics_only" Server configuration keyword
   available. If configured, some properties of the SessionMBeans can now issue
   null values (see the docs for details).</p>

<p>Extended the ThreadPoolMBeans to report statistics on CPU usage and blocked
   state for the threads. Since these statistics need enablement at JVM level,
   suitable enabling methods have also been added both in the ThreadPoolMBeans
   and, at global level, in the LoadMBean. See the docs for details.</p>

<p>Changed the names used in the PushNotificationsMBean to identify the MPN platforms,
   according to the changes in the SDK for In-Process Adapters.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom managers invoking the
   getCurrentMPNDevice or getMPNDevicePlatformType operation should be aligned.</span></p>

<p>Added a new MBean EditionDetails to recap license characteristics.<br/>
   The getLSEdition and getLSLicenseType methods in the ServerMBean will also reflect
   the new concepts.<br/>
   Added getEditionConfigFile and getEditionConfigAsProperties in the ServerMBean to
   reflect the new configuration deployment, as lightstreamer_version_conf.xml has been
   replaced by lightstreamer_edition_conf.xml. The previous getVersionConfigFile and
   getVersionConfigAsProperties methods now refer to the new file, but have been
   deprecated.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which caused the extension on the Resource MBean introduced in build 1803
   (that is, the handling of multiple subrequests) to become ineffective.<br/>
   Clarified the documentation of the Resource MBean with respect to the abovementioned
   extension.</p>

<p>Introduced the computation of the ThreadPool MBean's AvgExecTimeMillis property
   also for the TLS-SSL HANDSHAKE pool. Previously, the property was not computed
   (as for all cpu-bound pool) and its value was always null.</p>

<p>Modified the statistics on Control Requests (hence, on all Requests as well) in the
   Resource MBean, so that, when a single Request from the client comprises multiple
   subrequests, the count will report all subrequests rather that the aggregated one.</p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 16 Jul 2015</div></span>

<p>Modified the Session MBean, by removing the recently added ClientBuild property
   and extending the ClientVersion property to report the full version signature.
   <span class="compatibility"> COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom managers relying on the
   ClientBuild attribute, or on ClientVersion to report only a version number,

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 21 Jan 2015</div></span>

<p>Introduced the support for the new Push Notification Service. This includes
   the new PushNotifications MBean and extensions in the DataAdapter, AdapterSet,
   Server, and Load MBeans, to report the served devices and the new thread pools.</p>

<p>Introduced the ThreadPool MBeans, one for each of the thread pools used internally
   by Lightstreamer Server. See the ThreadPoolMBean class documentation for details.<br/>
   Extended the Load MBean to provide a list of the names of all active thread
   pools (see getThreadPools). Note that the pool naming has changed in Server
   version 6.0.</p>

<p>Introduced a fake MBean of type "Session" and no SessionId associated, which is
   added when the creation of the Session MBeans is disabled; it acts as a reminder
   that the feature can be enabled. <span class="compatibility"> COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
   Custom managers should recognize and ignore the new MBean; it does not expose
   the properties of a normal Session MBean.</span>
   Added a "destroySession" operation in the Resource MBean; this overcomes the
   unavailability of this functionality when Session MBeans are disabled. </p>

<p>Introduced the "clearSnapshot" operations on the DataAdapter MBeans,
   for clearing the state of an item bypassing the Data Adapter (or, in DISTINCT
   mode, for notifying compatible clients that the update history should be discarded).
   See the documentation for details and usage clarifications.</p>

<p>Extended the Resource MBean and the DataAdapter MBeans with new statistics
   on the overall number of item subscriptions performed by the clients
   (see get*ItemSubscriptions).</p>

<p>Extended the Session MBean with information on the Client SDK type, if available
   (see getClientType and getClientVersion).</p>

<p>Extended the life of the Session MBean until the termination of the
   notifySessionClose invocation; hence, from within this callback, the Metadata
   Adapter can access the MBean and get the final value of cumulative statistics.<br/>
   Added, for completeness, the IsClosed property (which is true in that case).</p>

<p>Fixed the getSessionListForItem method in the DataAdapter MBeans to return an
   empty list instead of null upon items not subscribed to.</p>

<p>Clarified the docs about the inclusion of "prestarted" sessions.</p>

<p>Fixed wrong links in the docs.</p>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with custom managers for the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Dec 2012</div></span>

<p>Extended the Stream MBean and the Session MBean, with new properties carrying statistics
   on the elaboration of Client Messages, sent through the SendMessage requests. See the
   documentation for details.</p>


<div class="version">4.3 build 1576</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 5.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with custom managers for the previous version;

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 3 Aug 2012</div></span>

<p>Revised the reporting of bandwidth limits in the Session and Stream MBeans.<br/>
Fixed an inconsistency in the Session MBean; the AllocatedMaxBandwidthKbps
property getter now returns the server-side bandwidth limit for the Session,
according with the setter behavior; before, it used to return the limit currently
enforced on the session, which is now returned by the new read-only property
AllocatedBandwidthKbps. <span class="compatibility"> COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom
managers that use the AllocatedMaxBandwidthKbps getter may need to be changed.
</span>
Clarified when the special 0 value is possible in bandwidth limit values.<br/>
Introduced a 3-decimal approximation for the reported bandwidth limit values.
<span class="compatibility"> COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom managers that rely
on the reported bandwidth limits for internal computations may need to be
revised.</span></p>

<p>Changed the count of the overall number of connected sockets in the
Resource MBean to include sockets currently involved in the initial TLS/SSL
handshake.<br/>
Extended the Resource MBean by introducing the count of sockets currently
performing a TLS/SSL initial handshake and the count of failed handshakes.</p>

<p>Extended the Resource MBean with new properties to report the connections
used for WebSocket interaction. The current and maximum number of such
connections and the cumulative number of upgrades from HTTP/HTTPS are reported.
See the documentation for details.</p>

<p>Extended the Load MBean to report the current queue on the newly introduced
thread pools; see "getQueueStageHandshake".<br/>
Removed from the Load MBean the previously deprecated "getQueueStageIOPush"
and "getQueueStageHTTPSAccept" methods. <span class="compatibility">
COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom managers that still request these properties may
may need to be revised.</span></p>

<p>Revised the various session count statistics in the Resource MBean: prestarted sessions
   are no longer included; see CLIENTS.SESSIONS in paragraph 4.2.1 of the General Concepts
   document for details.<br/>
   Extended the Resource MBean to provide the count of current prestarted sessions.<br/>
   Extended the Session MBean to indicate when a session is in prestarted state.</p>

<p>Removed the deprecated getSubscribedItemList and getSubscribedItems methods from the
   Session MBean. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Any custom managers still
   using those methods may have to be changed.</span>

<p>Added the getVersionConfigFile and getVersionConfigAsProperties methods in the Server MBean
   to make it available the contents of the newly introduced version configuration file.</p>

<p>Changed the names returned by getLSLicenseType in the Server MBean, according to the new
   licensing policy.</p>

<p>Fixed the comment on the "CumulControlRequest" property of the Session MBean
   on the html adaptor.</p>

<p>Refined the periodic statistics carried by the getAveragePoolQueueWait
property of the Load MBean.</p>

<p>Fixed the included Version.txt file, which was not reporting the latest build number.</p>

<p>Regenerated the API documentation with the newest JDK default template.<br/>
   Specified the version number in the javadocs.</p>

<div class="version">1.8.1 build 84</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Server since 7.0.</div>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Remoting SDKs based on the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 28 Feb 2018</div></span>

<p>Added a new configuration parameter, "keepalive_timeout_millis", for both Proxy
Metadata and Data Adapters. The new configuration allows to set a timeout for received
data and keepalives from the Remote Adapters to detect unresponsive connections
(that will be handled differently by the "robust" and "non robust" versions.
See the sample adapters.xml files for details.</p>

<p>Aligned the protocol documentation to comply with current licensing policies.</p>

<p>Modified the communication protocol for the Remote Metadata Adapters
   in the part related to the MPN Module, after its full revision.
   <span class="notInAMS">
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Only if the MPN Module

   But note that the MPN Module is not available with this edition.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Remote Metadata

   </span></p>

<p>Changed the default of the &lt;sequentialize_table_notifications&gt; flag
   available in adapters.xml from Y to N, to better cope with cases in which
   many subscriptions are performed at once. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If any existing Remote Metadata Adapter relies on the invocations
   of notifyNewTables and notifyTablesClose for the same session to never overlap,
   ensure that the flag is explicitly configured as Y for this Adapter.</span></p>

<p>Improved some error messages.</p>

<p>Changed the preconfigured settings for the dedicated thread pools in the
   adapters.xml templates, to leverage the new defaults for the SERVER pool.</p>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Remoting SDKs based on the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 23 Jan 2017</div></span>

<p>Introduced a "first_connection_timeout_millis" configuration parameter for
   the Robust Proxy Data Adapter, similarly to what is available for the
   Robust Metadata case (but with a 0 default, which is consistent with the
   previous behavior).</p>

<p>Introduced a new strategy for the "events_recovery" configuration parameter
   of the Robust Proxy Data Adapter. See "enforce_snapshot" in the sample
   configuration file under "adapter_robust_conf_template".</p>

<p>Extended the configuration templates to advertise the variable-expansion

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 21 Jan 2015</div></span>

<p>Embedded the Proxy Adapter binaries related with the current version of the
   Adapter Remoting Infrastructure. Previously, the ls-proxy-adapters.jar file
   supplied by the ARI SDK had to be added to the Adapter Set libraries.
   As a consequence, the ls-proxy-adapters.jar binaries are no longer provided
   directly. As a further consequence, the compatibility constraint of the
   Adapter Remoting Infrastructure is now stated directly with respect to the
   Server. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Adapter Set
   deployments based on the old Proxy Adapters supplied in ls-proxy-adapters.jar
   are supported seamlessly.</span></p>

<p>Introduced the "PROXY_FOR_REMOTE_ADAPTER" and "ROBUST_PROXY_FOR_REMOTE_ADAPTER"
   reserved names to be used in place of the class names for the inclusion of
   the new embededd Proxy Adapters in adapters.xml.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: The new reserved names are not
   expected to conflict with custom class names in an existing adapters.xml.</span>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: In order to port an existing
   Adapter Set configured for Remote Adapters to the new Proxy Adapters, the adapters.xml
   configuration file has to be changed to comply with the new naming (and
   ls-proxy-adapters.jar can be discarded).</span></p>

<p>Introduced an explicit initialization request sent by the Proxy Adapters
   to the Remote Adapters upon connection. This now allows for:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Defining parameters for the Remote Adapter directly in the configuration
   block of the Proxy Adapter.</li>
   <li>Having the Proxy Adapter send its own identification information to the
   Remote Adapter. With a "Robust" version of a Proxy Adapter, this also means
   notifying the Remote Adapter of the instance identity of the Proxy Adapter
   (hence the Server), so that if a previous detached instance of Remote Adapter
   has persisted any context information, this information can be identified
   and retrieved by the new instance.</li>
   <li>Having the Remote Adapter inform the Proxy Adapter in case of any
   initialization issue, instead of just having the Remote Server refrain from
   connecting.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>See "remote_params_prefix" in the sample "adapters.xml" files for details
   on how the initialization parameters can be specified.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Remote Servers based
   on the .NET and Generic Adapter SDKs have to be upgraded to the new SDK version.
   However, backward compatibility can be restored by disabling the new request
   through the new "init_remote" configuration parameter.</span></p>

<p>Discontinued the support for the "Piped" versions of the Proxy Adapters.
   Only the "Networked" versions and their "Robust" extensions are now available.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing installations based
   on the "Piped" versions should be ported to the "Networked" versions. But
   we don't expect this case to occur for production deployments, as the use
   of the "Piped" versions was not recommended for production.</span>
   Removed the "eos_count_limit" and "eos_sleep_time" configuration parameters,
   which were only used by the "Piped" versions of the Proxy Adapters.</p>

<p>Introduced the "remote_address_whitelist" parameter, to be used to specify a list of IP
   addresses, from where Remote Adapter connections are accepted by a Proxy Adapter.
   If missing, connections are still accepted from any host.</p>

<p>Changed the logger names used by the Proxy Adapters for their own logging
   and replaced the old logger configuration with the new one in the Server's
   factory log configuration file (see the supplied file for details).
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: To keep using an existing
   log configuration file, the logger should be manually replaced too.
   Obviously, as long as existing Adapter Set deployments based on the old
   Proxy Adapters are in use, the old logger should also be kept.</span></p>

<p>Removed the description of the ARI protocol (made available to custom
   Remote Servers for implementing the Adapter interface via TCP) from the scope
   of this component. Now, the "Adapter Remoting Infrastructure" component
   (no longer an SDK) only covers Lightstreamer-Server-side support (based
   on the Proxy Adapters) for all remoting SDKs.
   See the new "SDK for Generic Adapters" for the ARI protocol topic.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the introduction, in Server version 6.0, of separate ClassLoaders
   for the loading of the external libraries used by the Server internally, specifed the suggested
   settings in the factory Proxy Adapter configuration (through the new &lt;classloader&gt;
   setting), to enforce sharing of the slf4j/logback logging libraries with the Server.
   This confirms the previous behavior, hence the log configuration of the Proxy Adapters
   is still included in the Server log configuration file.</p>

<p>Revised the factory configuration of the optional thread pools in adapters.xml;
   with the new suggested configuration, some adapter-related pools are enabled
   and will take on some tasks previously falling in the "SERVER" pool.</p>

<p>Revised the default naming of connections (for logging purposes) and related threads,
   by leaning on the configured proxy names instead of progressive numbers.<br/>
   Introduced name suffixes to distinguish subsequent streams that may be
   created by the Robust Proxy Metadata Adapter.</p>

<p>Moved the configuration examples (which include parameter descriptions) under "doc".<br/>
   Provided a new introductory document.</p>

<p>Revised and relieved the Notes on Method Sequence for the Notify New Tables
   and Notify Tables Close methods, according with the locking policy change
   and the new &lt;sequentialize_table_notifications&gt; parameter introduced
   in SDK for Java Adapters version 5.1.</p>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Remote Servers for the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 9 Aug 2012</div></span>

<p>Revised the low level log of the Proxy Adapters, to allow for suppressing
   the log of real-time messages while logging the requests and replies from
   the Remote Server; see com.lightstreamer.adapters.remote in the Server log
   configuration file.</br>
   Fixed a typo in the com.lightstreamer.adapters.remote logger description.</p>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Remote Servers for the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 6 Apr 2012</div></span>

<p>Introduced new configuration properties to let the RobustNetworkedMetadataProvider
  return a custom error notification to the client upon a request for a new session
  when the Remote Server is currently unavailable; see "notify_user_disconnection_code"
  and "notify_user_disconnection_msg" in "conf\sockets(robust)\adapters.xml".</p>

<p>Introduced new configuration properties to let the RobustNetworkedDataProvider
  manage a custom item which carries notifications about the availability of the
  Remote Server; see "remote_adapter_status" in "conf\sockets(robust)\adapters.xml".</p>

<p>Added checks on the correct configuration of the Proxy Adapters; in fact, wrongly
  setting a notify port on a Proxy Metadata Adapter could lead to wrong behavior.</p>

<p>Improved the extraction of HTTP headers supplied by the "NUS"/"NUA" request.</p>

<p>Added log to detect issues caused by obsolete Remote Servers</p>

<p>Modified the interface in the part related to the MPN Module, after its
   full revision. <span class="notInAPV">But note that the MPN Module is not
   available with this edition.</span>
   Here is a resume of the changes:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Modified the signature of the notifyMpnDeviceAccess and
       notifyMpnDeviceTokenChange methods of the MetadataProvider interface,
       to add a session ID argument.
       <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Metadata Adapter
       source code has to be ported in order to be compiled with the new jar,
       unless the Adapter class inherits from one of the supplied FileBasedProvider,
       LiteralBasedProvider or MetadataProviderAdapter and the above methods are
       not defined.<br/>
       On the other hand, existing Metadata Adapter binaries are still supported
       <span class="notInAMS"> as long as the MPN Module is disabled.
       Otherwise, they should be recompiled after porting</span>.</span></li>

       <li>Revised the public constants defined in the MpnPlatformType class.
       The constants referring to the supported platforms have got new names and
       corresponding new values, whereas the constants for platforms not yet
       supported have been removed.
       <span class="notInAMS">
       <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Metadata Adapters
       explicitly referring to the constants have to be aligned.
       Even if just testing the values of the MpnPlatformType objects received
       from MpnDeviceInfo.getType, they still have to be aligned.</span>
       </span><span class="notInAPV">
       <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: No issues are expected
       on existing Metadata Adapters, because the MpnPlatformType class is
       supposed to be never used.</span>
       </span></li>

       <li>Removed the subclasses of MpnSubscriptionInfo (namely
       MpnApnsSubscriptionInfo and MpnGcmSubscriptionInfo) that were used
       by the Server to supply the attributes of the MPN subscriptions
       in notifyMpnSubscriptionActivation. Now, simple instances of
       MpnSubscriptionInfo will be supplied and attribute information can be
       obtained through the new getNotificationFormat method.
       <span class="notInAMS">
       See the MPN chapter on the General Concepts document for details on the
       characteristics of the Notification Format.

       <li>Added equality checks based on the content in MpnDeviceInfo,
       MpnPlatformType, and MpnSubscriptionInfo.</li>

       <li>Improved the interface documentation in various parts.</li>
   </ul>
   
<p>Changed the default of the &lt;sequentialize_table_notifications&gt; flag
   available in adapters.xml from Y to N, to better cope with cases in which
   many subscriptions are performed at once. <span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If any existing Metadata Adapter relies on the invocations
   of notifyNewTables and notifyTablesClose for the same session to never overlap,
   ensure that the flag is explicitly configured as Y for this Adapter.</span></p>

<p>Changed the preconfigured settings for the dedicated thread pools in the
   adapters.xml template, to leverage the new defaults for the SERVER pool.</p>

<p>Clarified in the docs for notifySessionClose which race conditions with other
   methods can be expected.</p>

<p>Aligned the documentation to comply with current licensing policies.</p>

<p>Extended the MetadataProvider interface to support the new
   Push Notification Service (aka MPN Module). When enabled, the new methods will be
   invoked in order to validate client requests related with the service. See the
   Javadocs for details (see also the &lt;mpn_pool&gt; element in the sample
   adapters.xml for Adapter related thread pool configuration).
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Metadata Adapter source
   code has to be extended in order to be compiled with the new jar (the new methods
   could just throw a NotificationException), unless the Adapter class inherits
   from one of the supplied FileBasedProvider, LiteralBasedProvider or
   MetadataProviderAdapter. In the latter case, the Adapter will accept any
   MPN-related request; however, MPN-related client requests can be satisfied only
   if the involved "app" has been properly configured.<br/>
   On the other hand, existing Metadata Adapter binaries are still supported
   (but for the unlikely case of a name conflict with the new methods) and will
   refuse any MPN-related request (unless the Adapter class inherits from one of
   the supplied FileBasedProvider, LiteralBasedProvider or MetadataProviderAdapter,
   where the above considerations hold).</span>
   <span class="notInAPV">However, the MPN Module is not available with
   this edition.</span></p>

<p>Changed the initialization order for Metadata Adapters and Data Adapters.
   By default the Metadata Adapter is initialised before any Data Adapter of the
   same Adapter Set.
   The optional configuration parameter "metadata_adapter_initialised_first" has
   been added to the adapters.xml configuration file to initialise the Metadata
   Adapter in parallel with the Data Adapters.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Adapter Sets relying
   on a concurrent initialization of Data and Metadata Adapters (may be the case
   for Remote Adapters) should use the "metadata_adapter_initialised_first"
   configuration parameter to restore the parallel initialization.</span>
   Distinct Adapter Sets are initialised in parallel as before.</p>

<p>Introduced the "clearSnapshot"/"smartClearSnapshot" operations on the
   ItemEventListener, for clearing the state of an item in a single step (or, in
   DISTINCT mode, for notifying compatible clients that the update history should
   be discarded). See the javadocs for details.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Data Adapters don't need
   to be recompiled.</span>
   Extended some demo source code to show how the new methods can be invoked.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the introduction of separate ClassLoaders for the loading
   of the external libraries used by Lightstreamer Server internally, all these libraries
   are no longer visible from Adapter code.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Adapters that lean on libraries
   included by Lightstreamer Server should now include these libraries explicitly.
   Sharing of library state is no longer possible,
   but it was not supposed to be leveraged anyway.<br/>
   The only exception is for logging. If any Adapter leans on the instance of slf4j/logback
   included by the Server (perhaps in order to share the log configuration), it can be
   configured to share these libraries through the new &lt;classloader&gt; setting in
   adapters.xml (see the sample adapters.xml for details). In particular, this is the
   case for Proxy Adapters.<br/>However, note that the slf4j and logback libraries have
   been updated; hence, if any custom Adapter has to keep sharing these libraries,
   check out the slf4j and logback changelogs for any compatibility issues.</span></p>

<p>Introduced separate ClassLoaders for loading the resources related with the various
   Adapter Sets. As a consequence, classes pertaining to different Adapter Sets can
   no longer see each other, though they can still share any classes defined in the
   "shared" folder. By the way, note that any classes found in "lib" and "classes" under
   the Adapter Set folder are now added to the Adapter Set ClassLoader, even if all
   the Adapters declare a different dedicated &lt;install_dir&gt;.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Adapter code that leans
   on class sharing between the Adapter Sets may fail; however, the old behavior can
   be restored by simply placing all jars and classes in the "shared" folder.</span>
   Moreover, introduced the possibility of loading the classes of single Metadata or
   Data Adapters in dedicated ClassLoaders (still inheriting from the ClassLoader of
   the Adapter Set); see the new &lt;classloader&gt; configuration element in the sample
   adapters.xml for details.<p/>

<p>Fixed a race condition that, in principle, could have caused notifySessionClose
   to be invoked twice on the same session.</p>

<p>Embedded the binaries of the basic LiteralBasedProvider in ls-adapter-interface.jar.
   As a consequence, the ls-generic-adapters.jar file is no longer provided. Note that
   this library was also predeployed in the "shared" folder.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If an existing Adapter installation
   is based on the LiteralBasedProvider and includes the ls-generic-adapters.jar file
   within its own folder, the jar should be removed to avoid confusion.</span>
   Also note that the removed library also included the sample FileBasedProvider,
   which is no longer provided. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: in the
   unlikely case of an existing Adapter installation based on the FileBasedProvider,
   the old ls-generic-adapters.jar should be left; if it had been left in the "shared"
   folder, it is recommended to place it within the Adapter's own folder.</span>
   Extended the interface Javadocs to include the LiteralBasedProvider, previously
   documented under the "examples" folder.</p>

<p>Introduced a sample adapters.xml configuration file, which includes the description
   of all parameters, in the new "adapter_conf_template" folder under "docs".
   It should be used as the reference for adapters.xml writing.
   On the other hand, the adapter configuration file of the preinstalled welcome page
   is no longer meant as a reference.</p>

<p>Revised the factory configuration of the optional thread pools in adapters.xml;
   with the new suggested configuration, some adapter-related pools are enabled
   and will take on some tasks previously falling in the "SERVER" pool.<br/>
   Clarified the docs with regard to the thread pools involved in the various adapter
   invocations.</p>

<p>Added details in the debug log of events received from the Data Adapters.</p>

<p>Fixed an error in the documentation of getWinIndex in the TableInfo class;
   clarified how the field can be used to match subscription and unsubscription requests.</p>

<p>Fixed some truncated short descriptions in the javadocs.</p>

<p>Improved the Javadoc, with introductory notes and instructions on the use
   of the sample LiteralBasedProvider.</p>

<p>Removed the examples, which are now only hosted on GitHub and managed through
   the new "demos" site. Provided suitable references to find the examples there.</p>

<p>Changed the SDK name, which was "SDK for Java Adapters", to avoid confusion
   with the new SDK for Java Remote Adapters.</p>

<p>Relieved the locking policy on the invocation of the "notifyNewTables" and
   "notifyTablesClose" callbacks, so that delays on the callback execution no longer
   propagate to the update flow for the session. As a consequence, blocking implementations
   of "notifyNewTables" are now allowed. See the javadocs for details.<br/>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: In some cases, the relative order
   of data and notification events may change, but only when different tables
   are involved, in which case no order specification has never been claimed.</span>
   This also fixes an issue in the support of the Adapter Remoting Infrastructure,
   in which the implementation of "notifyNewTables" can't but be potentially blocking.</p>

<p>Introduced the &lt;sequentialize_table_notifications&gt; tag in the Metadata Adapter
   configuration, to allow for also relieving the sequentialization constraint
   on the "notifyNewTables" and "notifyTablesClose" callbacks, so that delays
   on the callback execution would not even propagate to other subscription requests
   for the session. See the inline comment in the demos "adapters.xml" for details.</p>

<p>Fixed a typo in the documentation of the init method of both adapters, where "adapter_conf.id"
   was reported instead of "adapters_conf.id".</p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 10 May 2016</div></span>

<p>Introduced parallelization of the invocations of methods on the Remote
   Metadata Adapter; in fact, previously, the invocations were always done
   sequentially, with possible inefficient use of the available resources
   (invocations for the Data Adapter were already done in parallel).
   Also introduced suitable configuration; see the docs for
   MetadataProviderServer and DataProviderServer for details.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If existing Remote
   Metadata Adapters don't support concurrent invocations, sequential
   invocations should be restored by configuration.</span></p>

<p>Introduced the possibility to configure the keepalive time (which was fixed
   to one second) through the custom "lightstreamer.keepalive.millis"
   system property.</p>

<p>Fixed the API documentation of class Server, by removing the method "init".
   In fact, the method was not meant to be public.</p>

<p>Improved logging; now the detailed log of request-reply messages not including
   notification messages (i.e. data updates) is possible. Moreover, the keepalives
   can now be excluded from the the detailed log of request, reply and notification
   messages.</p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Dec 2017</div></span>

<p>Modified the interface in the part related to Mobile Push Notifications,
   after the full revision of the Server's MPN Module.
   <span class="notInAPV">But note that the MPN Module is not available with this edition.</span>
   In particular:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Modified the signature of the NotifyMpnDeviceAccess and
       NotifyMpnDeviceTokenChange methods of the MetadataProvider interface,
       to add a session ID argument.
       <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Remote Metadata Adapter
       source code has to be ported in order to be compiled with the new dll,
       unless the Adapter class inherits from the supplied MetadataProviderAdapter
       or LiteralBasedProvider and the above methods are not defined.<br/>
       On the other hand, existing Remote Metadata Adapter binaries still run
       with the new version of Lightstreamer Server and the Proxy Adapters,
       as long as they keep being hosted by an old version of the .NET Adapter SDK
       <span class="notInAMS"> and the MPN Module is disabled.
       Otherwise, they should be ported to the new SDK version and recompiled</span>.
       </span></li>

       <li>Revised the public constants defined in the MpnPlatformType class.
       The constants referring to the supported platforms have got new names and
       corresponding new values, whereas the constants for platforms not yet
       supported have been removed.
       <span class="notInAMS">
       <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Remote Metadata Adapters
       explicitly referring to the constants have to be aligned.
       Even if just testing the values of the MpnPlatformType objects received
       as MpnDeviceInfo.Type, they still have to be aligned.</span>
       </span><span class="notInAPV">
       <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: No issues are expected
       on existing Remote Metadata Adapters, because the MpnPlatformType class is
       supposed to be never used.</span>
       </span></li>

       <li>Removed the subclasses of MpnSubscriptionInfo (namely
       MpnApnsSubscriptionInfo and MpnGcmSubscriptionInfo) that were used
       by the SDK library to supply the attributes of the MPN subscriptions
       in NotifyMpnSubscriptionActivation. Now, simple instances of
       MpnSubscriptionInfo will be supplied and attribute information can be
       obtained through the new NotificationFormat property.
       <span class="notInAMS">
       See the MPN chapter on the General Concepts document for details on the
       characteristics of the Notification Format.
       <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Remote Metadata Adapters
       leveraging NotifyMpnSubscriptionActivation and inspecting the supplied
       MpnSubscriptionInfo have to be ported to the new class contract.</span>

       <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: No issues are expected
       on existing Remote Metadata Adapters, because NotifyMpnSubscriptionActivation
       is supposed not to be implemented.</span>
       </span></li>

       <li>Added equality checks based on the content in MpnDeviceInfo and MpnSubscriptionInfo.</li>

       <li>Improved the interface documentation in various parts.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Added checks to protect the MetadataProviderServer and DataProviderServer objects
   from reuse, which is forbidden.</p>

<p>Clarified in the docs for notifySessionClose which race conditions with other
   methods can be expected.</p>

<p>Aligned the documentation to comply with current licensing policies.</p>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 23 Jan 2017</div></span>

<p>Improved the app configuration example, by showing how to configure the
   keepalive messages.</p>


<div class="version">1.10.0 build 1017 (dll version 1.10.5962.17870 - Strong Name dll version 1.10.5962.17871)</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Adapter Remoting Infrastructure since 1.7.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 10 May 2016</div></span>

<p>Dropped the compatibility with .NET environment versions prior to 4.0.
   4.0 or later is now required.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Check the .NET runtime
   environment in use before updating existing Remote Adapter installations.
   If the Remote Adapter is run by a custom launcher, and if the application
   had been compiled for an earlier .NET environment, the loading of the new
   library may fail. In this case, the application has to be recompiled and
   possibly ported to a 4.0 or later target environment.</span></p>

<p>As a consequence of the new runtime requirements, the names of the provided
   exe and dll files have changed, to lose the _N2 suffix.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Remote Adapter
   installations may require some renaming within some custom script.
   If the Remote Adapter is run by a custom launcher, a rebuild of the
   application may be needed to refer to the new dll name.</span></p>

<p>Introduced parallelization of the invocations of methods on the Remote
   Metadata Adapter; in fact, previously, the invocations were always done
   sequentially, with possible inefficient use of the available resources.
   Several policies are now available for both Metadata and Data Adapter method
   invocation, and can be configured through the application configuration;
   see the new sample file in the new "conf" directory for details.<br/>
   By default, the invocations to the Metadata Adapter methods are now done
   in parallel.<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If existing
   Remote Metadata Adapters don't support concurrent invocations, sequential
   invocations should be restored by configuration.</span></p>

<p>Introduced the possibility to configure the keepalive time (which was fixed
   to one second) through the application configuration; see the new sample
   file in the new "conf" directory for details.</p>

<p>Improved logging; now the keepalives can be excluded from the the detailed
   log of request, reply and notification messages.</p>

<p>Fixed obsolete notes in the docs for DataProvider and MetadataProvider
   interfaces on the way implementations are supplied.</p>


<div class="version">1.9 build 1010 (dll version 1.9.5675.18260 - Strong Name dll version 1.9.5675.18262)</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Adapter Remoting Infrastructure since 1.7.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 16 Jul 2015</div></span>

<p>Improved logging; now the detailed log of request-reply messages not including
   notification messages (i.e. data updates) is possible.</p>

<p>Reduced some long pathnames in the docs pages, which could cause issues
   on some systems.</p>


<div class="version">1.9 build 1008 (dll version 1.9.5492.23212 - Strong Name dll version 1.9.5492.23215)</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Adapter Remoting Infrastructure since 1.7.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 21 Jan 2015</div></span>

<p>Introduced the possibility to provide Adapter initialization parameters
   directly from the Proxy Adapter configuration; such parameters (to be
   supplied as explained in the Adapter Remoting Infrastructure documentation)
   will be added to those already received by the Metadata or Data Adapter
   Init method.<br/>
   As a consequence, the Init method of a Remote Adapter is no longer invoked
   upon Remote Server startup, but only after the connection with the Proxy
   Adapter has been established. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
   The move of initialization stuff performed in the Init method from before
   to after the connection attempt may be undesirable. If this is the case:
   <ul>
   <li>if the Remote Adapter is run through the supplied DotNetServer_N2.exe,
   the new /initonstart argument can be added to the command line, to restore
   the old behavior;</li>
   <li>if the Remote Adapter is run by a custom launcher, the same can be
   achieved by creating the involved "MetadataProviderServer" or "DataProviderServer"
   with the new 1-argument constructor (see the docs);</li>
   <li>alternatively, with a custom launcher, any initialization stuff that
   must precede the connection may be moved out of the Adapter Init method,
   into a custom method of the Adapter class that can be directly invoked
   by the launcher before the invocation of Start on the involved
   "MetadataProviderServer" or "DataProviderServer";
   this would keep the advantages of the extension.</li>
   </ul></span></p>

<p>Extended the MetadataProvider interface to support the new
   Push Notification Service (aka MPN Module). When enabled, the new methods will be
   invoked in order to validate client requests related with the service. See the
   interface docs for details.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Remote Metadata Adapter
   source code has to be extended in order to be compiled with the new dll
   (the new methods could just throw a NotificationException),
   unless the Adapter class inherits from one of the supplied LiteralBasedProvider
   or MetadataProviderAdapter. In the latter case, the Adapter will accept
   any MPN-related request; however, MPN-related client requests can be satisfied
   only if the involved "app" has been properly configured.<br/>
   On the other hand, existing Remote Metadata Adapter binaries hosted by an old
   version of the .NET Adapter SDK still run with the new version of Lightstreamer
   Server and the Proxy Adapters, as long as the MPN Module is not enabled.</span>
   <span class="notInAPV">However, the MPN Module is not available with
   this edition.</span></p>

<p>Introduced the "ClearSnapshot" operations on the Remote Server's IItemEventListener,
   for clearing the state of an item in a single step (or, in DISTINCT mode, for
   notifying compatible clients that the update history should be discarded).
   See the interface docs for details. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
   Existing Data Adapters don't need to be extended or recompiled.</span></p>

<p>Removed the dependency of the SDK library from log4net for its own logging.
   Custom launchers should use the new static SetLoggerProvider function in the
   "Server" class to provide suitable consumers, by implementing new dedicated
   interfaces (see the docs for details).<span class="compatibility">
   COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing custom launchers will still run with the new
   SDK library, but they won't print any log coming from the library itself;
   in order to print such log, they have to be extended.</span>
   The supplied DotNetServer_N2.exe still leans on log4net, over which it
   forwards all library's log.<br/>
   Updated the included log4net dll to version 1.2.13; note that, according
   with the above change, the log4net library is no longer required in order
   to compile the Adapters, but only in order to run DotNetServer_N2.exe.</p>

<p>Changed DotNetServer_N2.exe so that the /host command line argument is now
   mandatory; this disallows the use in combination with the "Piped" versions
   of the Proxy Adapters. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
   this is just a consequence of the discontinuation of "Piped" versions brought
   by Adapter Remoting Infrastructure 1.7; see related notes.</span></p>

<p>Fixed an error in the documentation of the WinIndex property in the TableInfo class;
   clarified how the field can be used to match subscription and unsubscription requests.</p>

<p>Simplified the included documentation, to lean on the Adapter Remoting
   Infrastructure documentation for architectural aspects and on the available
   examples for the deployment aspects.</p>

<p>Removed the examples, which are now only hosted on GitHub and managed through
   the new "demos" site. Provided suitable references to find the examples there.</p>

<p>Modified the SDK versioning, which now differs from the internal dll versioning.</p>

   <span class="notInAPV">But note that the MPN Module is not available with this edition.</span>
   In particular:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Extended the specifications of the "request" argument for the
       notifyMpnDeviceAccess and notifyMpnDeviceTokenChange event handlers
       of the MetadataProvider object, to add a session ID attribute.</li>

       <li>Wholly revised the specifications of the "request" argument for the
       notifyMpnSubscriptionActivation event handler of the MetadataProvider
       object, in the part that reports the platform-specific attributes
       of the MPN subscription. A new notificationFormat property is now used,
       which contains the platform-specific attributes in a json string.
       <span class="notInAMS">
       See the MPN chapter on the General Concepts document for details on the
       platform-specific attributes (i.e. the Notification Format).
       <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Remote Metadata Adapters

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 24 Feb 2017</div></span>

<p>Fixed the error() method of the MetadataResponse class, whose support for the
"credits" and "conflictingSession" response was incomplete; sending such
a response would have caused a wrong message to be sent to the Server and the
message would have been refused.
The new optional exceptionData argument has been added; see the API docs for
details. Sending a "credits" or "conflictingSession" response now requires the
new argument; if omitted or wrong, an exception will be thrown.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code sending "credits"
or "conflictingSession" responses must be changed, although such code wouldn't
have worked anyway.</span></p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 21 Jan 2015</div></span>

<p>Introduced the possibility to provide Adapter initialization parameters
   directly from the Proxy Adapter configuration.
   Hence, a "init" event has been added to both the MetadataProvider and
   DataProvider objects; it will be triggered after the connection with the
   Proxy Adapter has been established and passed the new parameters (to be
   supplied as explained in the Adapter Remoting Infrastructure documentation).
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: The new events can be left
   unhandled, so no code changes are needed.</span></p>

<p>Extended the MetadataProvider object to support the new
   Push Notification Service (aka MPN Module). When enabled, the new events will be
   issued in order to validate client requests related with the service. See the
   docs for details.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Remote Metadata Adapter
   code is still supported (but for the unlikely case of a name conflict with
   the new events) and the Adapter will accept any MPN-related request;
   however, MPN-related client requests can be satisfied only if the involved "app"
   has been properly configured.</span>
   <span class="notInAPV">However, the MPN Module is not available with
   this edition.</span></p>

<p>Added the clearSnapshot method to the DataProvider object, for clearing
   the state of an item in a single step (or, in DISTINCT mode, for notifying
   compatible clients that the update history should be discarded).
   See the interface docs for details.</p>

<p>Improved interpretation of non-string values used as field value updates: while previously
   all "falsey" values, excluding the empty string, were interpreted as nulls now their string
   representation is assumed <span class="compatibility"> COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If a null was
   expected on the Client as a consequence to a falsey value passed to the adapter, such value
   has to be replaced with an explicit null or the Client has to be changed
   accordingly.</span></p>

<p>Improved the interface documentation.<br/>
   Fixed the documentation of some cases in the MetadataResponse class, which were
   confused with the corresponding requests.<br/>
   Introduced suitable documentation for the default behavior of the MetadataProvider
   object.</p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 21 Jan 2015</div></span>

<p>Introduced as a separate SDK to address the ARI Protocol, made available to custom
   Remote Servers for implementing the Adapter interface via TCP. For the history of
   the previous versions of the protocol, refer to the "Adapter Remoting Infrastructure"
   component, up to version 1.4.3.</p>

<p>Extended the protocol to introduce the possibility to provide Remote Servers
   with initialization parameters directly from the Proxy Adapter configuration.
   Hence, new "DPI" and "MPI" methods, for Data and Metadata Adapters respectively,
   have been added; they will be invoked on the request channel immediately after
   the connection and passed the new parameters (to be supplied as explained
   in the Adapter Remoting Infrastructure documentation). See the protocol
   documentation for details.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing Remote Servers have
   to be extended in order to accept and answer the new request, otherwise the
   connection will fail. However, the previous behavior can be enforced on the
   Proxy Adapter by disabling the new request through the new "init_remote"
   configuration parameter of the Proxy Adapter.</span></p>

<p>Extended the protocol with requests related with the new
   Push Notification Service (aka MPN Module). When enabled, the new requests will be
   issued in order to validate client requests related with the service. See the
   Protocol documentation for details.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: existing Remote Servers don't
   need to be extended as long as the MPN Module is not enabled.</span>
   <span class="notInAPV">However, the MPN Module is not available with
   this edition.</span></p>

<p>Introduced the "CLS" command on the Data Adapter notification channel
   for clearing the state of an item in a single step (or, in DISTINCT mode,
   for notifying compatible clients that the update history should be discarded).
   Refer to "clearSnapshot" in the Java In-Process Adapter SDK for details.</p>

<p>Clarified the protocol documentation with regard to the thread pools
   within Lightstreamer Server involved in the invocation of the various methods.</p>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with the previous version of the SDK for Flash Clients.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 3 Apr 2019</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently revised policy of reconnection attempts upon failed
   or unresponsive requests. In case of multiple failed attempts on unresponsive connections
   the retry delay was increased dynamically, but was not restored to the configured
   value after a successful connection. As a consequence, after a server or network
   unavailability lasting for a couple of minutes, further cases of server or network
   unavailability would be recovered in about one minute, even if much shorter.</p>

<p>Fixed an annoying formatting issue in the jsdoc page for ConnectionOptions.</p>


<div class="version">7.2.0 build 1776</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with the previous version of the SDK for Flash Clients.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 15 Mar 2019</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug causing the conversion into numbers of user-supplied string parameters 
   (e.g. in settings in ConnectionDetails and ConnectionOptions) which can be interpreted
   as numbers. For example a user name of the form '1e2' could have been converted into
   the number 100, then used as the string '100'.</p>

<p>Fixed several bugs in the session recovery mechanism:
   </p><ul>
   <li>Fixed a bug which could have caused, in case of a recovery failure
   due to the elapsing of the recently added "SessionRecoveryTimeout" setting, 
   the failure of the first subsequent attempt to create a new session.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug causing the client to always try a recovery when the ReconnectTimeout
   expired on a stalled session, regardless that the SessionRecoveryTimeout could be set
   as 0 to disable session recovery.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug that could have caused the silent discarding of control requests (e.g. subscriptions
   or messages) when the client was attempting the recovery of the current session.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug that could have caused session recovery to fail if preceded by a previous
   successful session recovery on the same session by more than a few seconds.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug triggered by a call to connect() or setForcedTransport() issued while the client
   was attempting the recovery of the current session. This caused the recovery to fail,
   but, then, the library might not reissue the current subscriptions on the newly created session.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Fixed a bug preventing the sharing of the connection among LightstreamerClient objects
   created on the same page.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug due to a race condition between a subscribe and a concurrent disconnect
   in a connection sharing scenario,
   which could have caused the subscription to be skipped upon a subsequent connect.</p>

<p>Modified the implementation of connect() when issued while the state is either
   DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY. The call will no longer interrupt
   the pending reconnection attempt, but it will be ignored, to lean on the current attempt.
   Note that a pending reconnection attempt can still be interrupted by issuing disconnect() first.<br/>
   Modified in a similar way the implementation of setForcedTransport(); when issued
   while the state is either DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   the call will no longer interrupt the pending reconnection attempt, but it will apply
   to the outcome of that connection attempt.</p>

<p>Wholly revised the policy of reconnection attempts upon failed or unresponsive requests.
   Now the only property related with this policy is "RetryDelay", which now affects both
   (1) the minimum time to wait before trying a new connection to the Server in case the previous one failed 
   for any reason and (2) the maximum time to wait for a response to a request before dropping the connection 
   and trying with a different approach.<br/>
   Previously, point (2) was related with the "ConnectTimeout" and "CurrentConnectTimeout" properties.
   Now, in case of multiple failed attempts on unresponsive connections (i.e. while in CONNECTING state),
   the timeout used may still be increased dynamically and can still be inspected through
   getCurrentConnectTimeout, but this behavior is no longer configurable.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that tries to take control of the
   connection timeouts will no longer be obeyed, but we assume that the new policy will bring
   an overall improvement. Note that, when in CONNECTING state, the current timeout can be restored
   by issuing disconnect() and then connect().</span>
   As a result of the change, methods setConnectTimeout, getConnectTimeout and setCurrentConnectTimeout 
   of ConnectionOptions have been deprecated, as the setters have no effect and the getter
   is now equivalent to getRetryDelay.<br/>
   Also changed the default value of the "RetryDelay" property from 2 seconds to 4 seconds.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the "EarlyWSOpenEnabled" property from true to false 
   (see ConnectionOptions.setEarlyWSOpenEnabled). This removes a potential incompatibility
   with cookie-based Load Balancers, at the expense of a possible slight delay in session startup.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the "SlowingEnabled" property from true to false 
   (see ConnectionOptions.setSlowingEnabled).</p>

<p>Fixed a mistake in the supplied generator.html page, whereby the "Include Promise polyfill"
   checkbox was only shown while one of the AMD options was selected. Actually, the checkbox
   was still obeyed, as expected, even when not visible.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Incremented the minor version number.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running the Server with a license
   of "file" type which enables Web Client SDK up to version 7.1 or earlier, clients based
   on this new version will not be accepted by the Server: a license upgrade will be needed.</span></p>


<div class="version">7.1.3 build 1767</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with the previous version of the SDK for Flash Clients.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 14 Jun 2018</div></span>

<p>Introduced a maximum time on attempts to recover the current session, after which
   a new session will be opened. The default is 15 seconds, but it can be customized
   with the newly added "SessionRecoveryTimeout" property in ConnectionOptions.
   This fixes a potential case of permanently unsuccessful recovery, if the
   &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting were leveraged in a Server cluster and a Server
   instance happened to leave a cluster and were not automatically restarted.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism triggered
   by the use of the &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting on the Server,
   which could have caused feasible recovery attempts to fail.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, by which,
   a sendMessage request issued while a recovery operation was in place,
   could have never been notified to the listener until the end of the session
   (at which point an "abort" notification would have been issued to the listener),
   even in case the recovery was successful.</p>

<p>Fixed a race condition, mostly possible while a session recovery was being
   attempted, which could have caused the delay of subscription requests
   due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>
   
<p>Addressed various issues related with connection sharing:
   </p><ul>
   <li>Improved the connection sharing mechanism, which, in some complex contexts where
   a page was unable to connect to a master, could have kept trying unsuccessfully.
   Now it would give up and open a separate connection.</li>
   <li>Removed sharing restrictions on Firefox 57 and above, introduced in version 7.1.0.
   Now, sharing will be available as soon as it is allowed by the browser.</li>
   <li>On the other hand, discontinued connection sharing support on browsers that don't provide
   the "shared worker" feature. However, on most of these browsers, connection sharing
   already failed for other reasons; it could have succeeded mainly on very old browsers.
   This fixes an issue with some browsers, like Chrome for Android, in which the attempt
   (bound to fail) to share the connection could have caused a spurious popup to appear
   or a blocked popup notification to be issued.</li>
   <li>Disabled sharing on UC Browser. This fixes compatibility issues which, in case
   of sharing configured, might have caused any connection attempt to fail.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Addressed a particular case of session interruption that was still not supported
   by the session recovery feature.</p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 23 Mar 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed a severe bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, by which,
   after the creation of a new session because of network issues, it was possible
   that subsequent successful session recovery would cause data loss.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, which,
   upon particular kinds of network issues and if the creation of a new session
   had been necessary, could have caused the client to skip the resuming of the
   active subscriptions.</p>

<p>Fixed an annoying typo in the documentation of onStatusChange regarding the
   "DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY" status.</p> 

<p>Improved the library log by splitting the "lightstreamer.subscriptions" category in three,
   with the introduction of "lightstreamer.messages" and "lightstreamer.requests".
   See setLoggerProvider in LightstreamerClient for details.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that collects log
   from the "lightstreamer.subscriptions" category should be ported. This obviously
   is not expected to affect production code.</span></p>

<p>Modified the default value of the "RetryDelay" property from 5000 to 2000 ms.
   This should help recovering from network outages of a few seconds, typical, for
   instance, of wifi/mobile network switches on mobile phones.</p>

<p>Extended the recovery mechanism to stalled sessions. Now, when the ReconnectTimeout
   expires, an attempt to recover the current session will be performed first.</p>

<p>Fixed a race condition, introduced in the previous build 1737, which could have caused
   the delay of subscription requests issued on a websocket session startup
   due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Improved compatibility with the latest versions of Edge and Safari. This required
   disabling connection sharing.</p>

<p>Improved the notification of closed sessions to the Server, to enforce a cleanup
   when a browser tab is closing.</p>

<p>Changed the internal folder from sdk_client_web_unified to sdk_client_web.</p>

<p>Added automatic recovery of sessions upon unexpected socket interruption during
   streaming or long polling. Now the library will perform an attempt to resume
   the session from the interruption point. The attempt may or may not succeed,
   also depending on the Server configuration of the recovery capability.<br/>
   As a consequence, introduced a new status, namely DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   to inform the application when a recovery attempt is being performed; hence,
   onStatusChange and getStatus can provide the new status.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that uses the status
   names received via onStatusChange or getStatus may have to be aligned.</span></p>
   
<p>Added the onServerKeepalive callback in the ClientListener. See the JSDocs for details.</p>

<p>Extended the reverse heartbeat mechanism, governed by the "ReverseHeartbeatInterval"
   property. Now, it will also allow the Server to detect when a client has abandoned
   a session although the socket remains open.<br/>
   Fixed a bug on sending reverse heartbeats to the Server, which, sometimes, could
   have caused the Server to report a syntax error.</p>

<p>Added the error codes 60 and 71 to "onServerError", to report cases in which the
   Server license does not allow the client version.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which caused the invocations to the "setReconnectTimeout" method
   in ConnectionOptions to be ignored.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the recovery of control requests upon session close and replacement,
   which, through a rare race condition, could have caused the block of all subsequent
   control requests.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that could affect the sorting of grid widgets requested through 
   setSort method in case of large numbers (greater that 1 million) and comma as
   thousands separator.</p>
   
<p>Fixed the documentation of the "ContentLength", "KeepaliveInterval", and
   "ReverseHeartbeatInterval" properties of ConnectionOptions, to clarify that
   a zero value is not allowed in the first and it is allowed in the others.</p>
   
<p>Put a workaround for a known issue with shared workers in Firefox 57 and above,
   which could have caused misbehavior in case of connection sharing.
   As a consequence, the support for connection sharing may be limited.</p>

<p>Aligned the "Web Client Guide" document with regard to the referred
   "Deployment Config Matrix", which had remained obsolete.</p>

<p>Improved subscription requests on WebSockets by removing unnecessary parts.</p>

<p>Improved the messages shown by the provided StatusWidget.</p>

<p>Aligned the documentation to comply with current licensing policies.</p>

<!-- <p class="notInAMS">Incremented the minor version number.
   Anyway, if running the Server with a license file that supports
   Web Client SDK up to version 7.0 or earlier, you must be running

<p>Removed a restriction on field names that can be supplied to a Subscription object
   within a "field list"; names made by numbers are now allowed. This includes the
   specification of field names as "data-field" attributes in DOM cells to be
   handled by StaticGrid or DynaGrid.
   Obviously, the final validation on field names is made by the Metadata Adapter.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in version 6.1 which prevented the "slowing algorithm"
   (see setSlowingEnabled) from working.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in setRequestedBufferSize, which caused the value "unlimited" to be
   ignored for subscriptions in MERGE mode, which would stick to the default buffer
   size of 1.</p>

<p>Revised the sendMessage implementation in the HTTP case, to limit recovery actions
   when messages are not to be ordered and a listener is not provided.<br/>
   Revised sendMessage to accept 0 as a legal value for the "delayTimeout" argument.</p>

<p>Revised the default setting for the "ContentLength" property of ConnectionOptions,
   to allow the library to set it to the best value.</p>

<p>Clarified in the documentation the meaning of null in setRequestedMaxFrequency
   and setRequestedBufferSize. Extended setRequestedMaxFrequency to allow the setting
   also when the subscription is "active" and the current value is null.</p>

<p>Revised the documentation of possible subscription error codes.</p>

<p>Fixed the Documentation of the FlashBridge class, which included spurious entries
   for names "onBridgeReadyCalled" and "callBridgeReady".</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that could prevent the transition to "cold" style of a cell in a grid,
   hence leaving it in "hot" state. This was only possible if the Server's
   &lt;delta_delivery&gt; setting had been forced to N.</p>

<p>Addressed a compatibility issue with the new Safari 10, which, on some environments,
   caused the cells associated with StaticGrid or DynaGrid objects not to be detected.</p>

<p>Fixed the handling of wrong calls to getFields and getFieldSchema on Subscription.
   In some cases, an exception different from the IllegalStateException was thrown.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that could affect connection sharing on old browsers when equipped
   with Norton Internet Security.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the logging support, which caused the setUseInnerHtml method of the
   DOMAppender to be ineffective (false was always meant).</p>

<p>Fixed the log produced by the library, as, between the window name (when available)
   and the timestamp a space was missing.</p>

<p>Renamed the SDK, which was named "SDK for JavaScript Clients". The new name
   also emphasizes that it is based on the Unified APIs, like an increasing
   number of other Client SDKs. Also renamed the internal folder
   from "sdk_client_javascript" to "sdk_client_web_unified".</p>

<p>Discontinued the documentation of the use of this library in a Node.js environment.
   Now the new SDK for Node.js Clients (Unified API) is available, with dedicated
   documentation and instructions on how to acquire the library from the npm service.</p>

<p>Discontinued the supply of the alternative versions of the library, which,
   however, can still be created with Generator.html. Also moved Generator.html
   under the lib folder. <br/>Note that the library version
   for Node.js was in AMD format and required to be included in a custom source
   together with RequireJS. The use of the library version available through the
   npm service (see the new Node.js Client SDK) is recommended instead.</p>

<p>Changed the names of some properties in the ConnectionOptions bean. To resume:
   </p><ul>
       <li>keepaliveMillis has become keepaliveInterval</li>
       <li>idleMillis has become idleTimeout</li>
       <li>pollingMillis has become pollingInterval</li>

   of the specified properties has to be ported to the new property names.</span></p>

<p>Separated the ConnectionSharing class from the LightstreamerClient: this means the class and its dependencies
can now be excluded using the Generator.html.
Hence, the API and usage for this class have changed:
  <code>
    clientInstance.connectionSharing.enableSharing(...);
    clientInstance.connectionSharing.isMaster();
  </code>
  becomes
  <code>
    clientInstance.enableSharing(new ConnectionSharing(...));
    clientInstance.isMaster();
  </code>
  where the parameters of the old enableSharing method and the new ConnectionSharing constructor are still the same.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: existing code leveraging enableSharing
should be ported, although old code still works for now (provided that the ConnectionSharing
class is not excluded via Generator.html); if no sharing at all is configured,
the enableSharing call can also be removed.</span>
When connection sharing is enabled, it is now possible to force the LightstreamerClient
to release sharing-related resources by using the enableSharing(null) call while DISCONNECTED.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced on version 6.2.6: the bug prevented the use of WebSockets
in some cases in which the user connection was switched from a non-WS-enabling
network to a WS-enabling one.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug: in case of a Subscription Error the client would still try to subscribe the Subscription again,
until a manual unsubscribe call was performed.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which prevented the invalid-license error from being notified on Node.js.</p>

<p>Changed the behavior of getConnectTimeout/setConnectTimeout. This setting now accepts the "auto" value.
If "auto" is specified, the timeout will be chosen (and possibly changed overtime)
by the library itself. Note that "auto" is also the new default value.
To check and/or modify the current timeout a new getter/setter pair is exposed:
getCurrentConnectTimeout/setCurrentConnectTimeout.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If the getConnectTimeout method is called by the client code
its receiving variable may now contain the string "auto"; moreover it is likely that getConnectTimeout calls
should be replaced by getCurrentConnectTimeout ones.</span>
See the docs for further details.</p>

<p>Slightly changed the reconnection policy upon unexpected errors affecting an active session.
In some known cases, the reconnection will no longer be immediate (with the risk of a fast
reconnection loop), but the configured retry delay will be applied.</p>

<p>Improved the support for connection sharing by taking advantage of the SharedWorker class,
where supported by the browser. As a consequence, sharing will now succeed in some
contexts in which it used not to take place.</p>

<p>Introduced a Promise polyfill (https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise). The polyfill is optional
and can be excluded using the Generator.html; in this case the library expects to find the Promise
class in the environment.</p>

<p>Fixed a wrong argument type in the docs for class FunctionAppender.<br/>
Fixed the documentation of onServerError and onStatusChange, to specify that onServerError
is always preceded, not followed, by onStatusChange with DISCONNECTED.<br/>
Fixed various links in the JSDocs. Also slightly revised the style of the JSDocs.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of the DOMAppender and FunctionAppender constructors,
which indicated optional arguments before a mandatory argument. Actually,
an argument qualified as optional can omitted only if not followed by further
arguments, hence arguments preceding a mandatory one are mandatory as well.<br/>
Aligned the documentation of all Appenders by removing the optionality attributes
to their common constructor arguments.<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
No change is needed to existing code, because each of these arguments can still
be omitted, as long as no subsequent arguments are supplied.</span>
Clarified the policy for optional function arguments in the docs introduction.</p>

<p>Removed from the documentation various classes that are not related
with the interface, but used to be provided as utilities.
The whole set of utility classes can be found on GitHub at the following address:
https://github.com/Lightstreamer/utility-toolkit-javascript<br/>
Removed also some log-related classes that are not needed for setting up the
library log, but used to be provided to offer a full reusable logging system.
The whole logging system can be found on GitHub at the following address:
https://github.com/Lightstreamer/utility-logging-javascript<br/>
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: These classes are still included
in the library as part of the implementation, so application code exploiting them
will keep working. However, any future changes related with these classes
will not be reported.</span></p>

<p class="notInAMS">Incremented the major version number.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running the Server with a license
file that supports Web Client SDK up to version 6.x or earlier, clients based on
this new version will not be accepted by the Server.</span></p>


<div class="version">6.2.7 build 1679.2</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with the previous version of the SDK for Flash Clients.</div>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced on version 6.1.4 which only affected the use on Node.js;
the effect was that, when the Server was unavailable, no more connection attempts
were tried.</p>

<p>Fixed an error in the JSDocs, where SimpleLoggerProvider was documented
as a module (with static methods); actually, it is a class, with instance
methods and an empty constructor.</p>


<div class="version">6.2.6 build 1678</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.</div>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with the previous version of the SDK for Flash Clients.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 16 Jul 2015</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug: when using the SDK library inside a WebWorker, setting the setCookieHandlingRequired flag
to true prevented the library from connecting.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the onClearSnapshot implementation of the DynaGrid/StaticGrid/Chart classes,
which caused it to have no effect.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the SimpleLoggerProvider.removeLoggerAppender method.</p>

<p>Fixed an error in the JSDoc: in the ClientListener.onStatusChange the status "CONNECTED:STREAM-SENSING"
was erroneously reported as "CONNECTED:STREAM-SENSE".</p>

<p>Prevented a serious error, on the opening of a WebSocket to a certain host, from blocking other
WebSockets connections to different hosts.</p>

<p>Changed the behavior of the addListener method for the LightstreamerClient, Subscription, Chart,
DynaGrid and StaticGrid classes: adding a second time the same listener instance now has no effect.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: if in existing code a same listener
was added two times to a certain instance, it will no longer receive the events twice;
moreover, upon the first invocation of removeListener it will be removed and it will stop
receiving events. Hence such code may need to be revised.</span></p>

<p>Introduced work-around for early XDomainRequest failures related to specific proxies.</p>

<p>Introduced partial compatibility with React Native: at the moment the Client can only connect
 in HTTP-POLLING mode.</p>

<p>Clarified in the docs that the RemoteAppender does not support log of "INFO" and "DEBUG" levels.</p>

<p>Changed the value of the LightstreamerClient.LIB_NAME static property to "javascript_client".</p>

<p>Changed the default value for the ConnectionOptions.setContentLength setting.</p>


<div class="version">6.2.5 build 1669</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with the previous version of the SDK for Flash Clients.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 13 Feb 2015</div></span>

<p>Introduced support for the new error related to the expiration of an active session on Lightstreamer Server
(error 48). The error is not forwarded to the ClientListener, a reconnection is performed instead.</p>

<p>Improved support for stickiness expiration on load balancers: if a client request pertaining to
the current session is sent to the wrong instance of Lightstreamer Server, the Client automatically terminates the current session
and opens a new one.</p>

<p>Fixed the Chart and ChartLine classes: positionXAxis and positionYAxis were supposed to accept
   negative values, but such values were explicitly blocked by their implementation.</p>

<p>Fixed a typo in the documentation of the "preventCrossWindowShare" parameter of "enableSharing".</p>

<p>Fixed the fade effect on IE&lt;=8 for cases where the end color is "transparent": in these cases
the fade effect will not be applied and a discrete switch will occur (previously there was no change
at all and the starting color was left).</p>

<p>Fixed the "inherited methods" section of the JSDocs: some methods were missing, others were pointing
to the wrong location. Also improved the readability of such list.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that, under rare circumstances, could have triggered a non-strict
   loop of requests for the xhr.html file.</p>


<div class="version">6.2.2 build 1664</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with the previous version of the SDK for Flash Clients.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 21 Jan 2015</div></span>

<p>Added the error code 30 in onServerError; the case is only predisposed for future special
   licenses.<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: custom clients which
   check the possible error outcomes don't have to be updated, as long as there is
   no change in license terms.</span></p>

<p>Extended the sendMessage with a new flag that permits to queue messages while the Client is offline.</p>

<p>Renamed the setRetryTimeout and getRetryTimeout methods into setRetryDelay and getRetryDelay.
   The old names are kept as aliases to mantain backward compatibility with previously written code.
   The behavior of the associated value is also changed: while the delay was previously started
   from the failure of the connection, it is now calculated from the start of the connection,
   thus absorbing any round-trip or timeout between the start of the connection and its failure.</p>

<p>Introduced the setFirstRetryMaxDelay and getFirstRetryMaxDelay settings. The actual delay
   is a randomized value between 0 and the value set on the property associated with the new
   methods. The randomization might help avoid a load spike on the cluster due to simultaneous
   reconnections, should one of the active servers be stopped.
   Previous versions of the SDK library had an hardcoded 0 value for this setting, the new 100ms
   default value should not introduce a noticeable difference.</p>

<p>Fixed the management of invalid key values when two-level push is active.
   Now an invalid key no longer causes the session to fail, but only a notification
   to onCommandSecondLevelSubscriptionError with the new code 14 is issued.<br/>
   Fixed the documentation of two-level push, to specify the implicit conditions
   that determine the (unlikely) cases in which a key value is invalid.</p>

<p>Fixed an error in the obfuscation process which, under rare circumstances,
   could have caused a "OpenAjax is not defined" exception.</p>

<p>Introduced the support for the new client identification mechanism.</p>

<p>Removed the examples, which are now only hosted on GitHub and managed through
   the new "demos" site. Provided suitable references to find the examples there.
   Example code for normal html pages should also be found on GitHub; the source
   code of the preinstalled welcome page is no longer meant as a reference.</p>

<p>Introduced the new setHttpExtraHeadersOnSessionCreationOnly/isHttpExtraHeadersOnSessionCreationOnly
   in the the ConnectionOptions class. Unlike with setHttpExtraHeaders,
   extra http headers will not be sent on all connections, but only during
   session creation; this still ensures that the headers will reach notifyUser
   and does not disable WebSocket connections.</p>

<p>Introduced the support for io.js.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that might have occasionally caused an error to be shown on the browser
   console (the text of the error was: 'Uncaught Executor error time: NaN').</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Incremented the minor version number.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running the Server with a license
file that supports Web Client SDK up to version 6.1 or earlier, clients based on
this new version will not be accepted by the Server.</span></p>


<div class="version">6.1.4 build 1640.11</div>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with the previous version of the SDK for Flash Clients.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 22 Jul 2014</div></span>

<p>Introduced the new setHttpExtraHeaders/getHttpExtraHeaders in the the ConnectionOptions class. It
is now possible to add extra http headers to the requests sent to Lightstreamer Server.
NOTE: Setting a non null value for this setting disables WebSockets.</p>

<p>Improved compatibility with redirect-based authentication mode used by some proxies.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the autoscroll behavior of the DynaGrid class: it was adhering to the documentation only if
listening to a DISTINCT Subscription.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug affecting IE8: if many Subscriptions were subscribed/unsubscribed to the LightstreamerClient in
a strict loop a "Stack overflow at line: 0" error might have been generated.</p>

<p>Fixed an incompatibility with phonegap applications running on Windows Phone 8.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug affecting Chrome, and potentially other browsers, that prevented the SDK library from working
correctly if, depending on the case, "Block sites from setting any data" or "Block third-party cookies and site data"
was selected on the Content settings.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced on version 6 that might have prevented the SDK library to behave correctly if
Websockets were not used (because of configuration or network/browser/intermediaries capabilities)
and a load balancer using cookie stickiness was placed between the Client and the servers.</p>


<div class="version">6.1.1 build 1640</div>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 10 Mar 2014</div></span>

<p>Fixed an issue with Chrome 33 and greater, where a harmless request
   for a page named "null" was performed to the web server.</p>

<p>Fixed an issue, introduced on version 6.1, with the Rekonq browser,
   that prevented the SDK library from correctly starting up.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that in rare cases could have prevented the recovery of a shared
connection in case of closure of the "master" Client.</p>

<p>Fixed an issue with Node.js on Linux that was observed in particular
   scenarios and, in these cases, prevented the connection.</p>


<div class="version">6.1 build 1634</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 5.1.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;

<div class="compatibility">Not compatible with the previous version of the SDK for Flash Clients.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 19 Feb 2014</div></span>

<p>Removed the need of cookie usage in most situations.</p>

<p>Added a onClearSnapshot callback to the SubscriptionListener.
The callback will be invoked upon a corresponding invocation of "clearSnapshot"
on the Adapter side for one of the subscribed items (provided that the Subscription
is for DISTINCT or COMMAND mode) with the request to accomplish the specified action.
Note that the "clearSnapshot" invocation is not available for Servers lower than version 6.0.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code will keep
working as long as, on the Adapter side, "clearSnapshot" is not used for items
in DISTINCT or COMMAND mode; otherwise, the item state on the Client may become
inconsistent, hence implementing the new callback would be mandatory.</span></p>

<p>Added a default handling of the onClearSnapshot event in the AbstractGrid class
that's thus reflected on subclasses:<br/>
All the rows/charts associated to an item receiveng the onClearSnapshot event are
removed from the widget.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that in rare cases could have made the Client send wrong-composed
requests to Lightstreamer Server. The bug had two effects, none of which caused any actual issue:
the Client may have sent extra useless requests; in response to such requests the
Server would have logged error messages in the log.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that prevented the correct execution of VisualUpdate.setCellValue calls
having null as second parameter.</p>

<p>Expand the ConnectionOptions.setForcedTransport method to accept "HTTP" and "WS"
values. These new values force the Client to only use the related transport without
forcing it into using a fixed connection method (i.e.: POLLING or STREAMING).</p>

<p>Fix a bug on the StaticGrid. Once sorted it may have routed updates to the wrong
rows.</p>

<p>Extended the Chart implementation to accept nulls as chart values. Nulls have
now special meanings: a single null (either on the X or Y axis) will make the Chart
ignore the update, a double null (on both the X and Y axis) will clear the involved
ChartLine.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: existing code will keep working as
long as the rule imposing to only feed the Chart with valid numbers was respected.
If not it is possible to leverage parsers for the Chart.setXAxis and Chart.addYAxis
methods to prevent nulls to reach the internal Chart engine.</p>

<p>Improved Node.js compatibility.</p>

<p>Revised the directory structure of the included examples.</p>

<p>Clarified the license terms for the included example source code.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Incremented the minor version number.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running Lightstreamer Server with a license
file that supports Web Client SDK up to version 6.0 or earlier, clients based on
this new version will not be accepted by the Server.</span></p>

<p>Improved the Chart class: now charts are printed using the &lt;canvas&gt; element. If &lt;canvas&gt; is not
available the SDK library will switch to the previous behavior.</p>

<p>Fixed an issue that may crash IE7 in case the SDK library needs to fallback to the "Unoptimized HTTP Polling".</p>

<p>Improved compatibility between Opera and the "Unoptimized HTTP Polling".</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the StaticGrid class: if the grid was bound to a COMMAND or DISTINCT Subscription and there were
more cells bound to the same field then the grid would have stopped showing updates on the HTML after a
clean or scroll operation.</p>

<p>Removed a potential memory leak: the disposal of a LightstreamerClient instance was leaving some resources behind.</p>

<p>Fixed generator.html to work on browsers when/where the console instance is not available.</p>

<p>Introduced a better handling of proxies that can forward the WebSocket handshake but can't properly handle the open WebSocket.</p>

<p>Fixed an issue with Firefox that might have caused a reconnection attempt to hang
   for many seconds after Lightstreamer Server had been unavailable for a while.</p>

<p>Fixed handling of string parameters entered in the ConnectionDetails and ConnectionOptions objects: a parameter
supposed to be a string may have been mistakenly parsed as a number resulting in heading 0 and . to be removed.</p>

<p>Improved style of the StatusWidget appearance by replacing any globally set BackgroundColor with a transparent one.</p>

<p>Added some missing [optional] flags to the documentation.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the Subscription class: when used in COMMAND mode, the "key" field of a "row" might have been mistakenly empty
if such "row" was removed (via a DELETE command) and then added again (via an ADD command) by the adapter.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the ItemUpdate.isValueChanged method: when used against a second-level field an erroneous true was returned.</p>

<p>Removed a 100/200 ms delay on subscriptions and messages that was erroneously introduced client-side. In case of file:///
executions the delay may also have been suffered during the dequeuing of received updates.</p>

<p>Improved send message performances.</p>

<p>Improved fallback mechanisms for Android stock browser.</p>

<p>Extended the supplied Monitor Demo with the newly available message-related statistics.</p>

<p>Added an example of integration with the Dojo libraries.
   Actually the example is hosted on GitHub and only a link is provided.</p>

<p>Included in the Client Guide document notes on how to configure the RequireJS
   optimization tool for use with a code including the JavaScript Client SDK library.</p>


<div class="version">6.0 build 1576</div>

<div class="compatibility">Not compatible with the previous version of the SDK for Flash Clients.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 3 Aug 2012</div></span>

<p>Introduced the new JavaScript Client SDK, which replaces the old HTML Client SDK
   with a brand new, fully redesigned, API and extended features, including:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>full support for WebSockets</li>
   <li>single-js-file library</li>
   <li>AMD-based modularization</li>
   <li>generator tool for deployment of library subsets (based on modules)</li>
   <li>support for out-of-browser apps (Node.js, PhoneGap, etc.)</li>
   <li>faster Stream-Sense algorithm</li>
   <li>support for cross-origin connections</li>
   <li>new logging facility and error handling</li>
   <li>new ready-made widgets, including a status indicator</li>
   </ul>
   <p>See the included documentation for any details.</br>
   The HTML Client SDK library shipped with the previous versions of Lightstreamer is still
   supported by Lightstreamer Server since Server version 4.0.</p>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 14 Mar 2019</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug causing the conversion into numbers of user-supplied string parameters 
   (e.g. in settings in ConnectionDetails and ConnectionOptions) which can be interpreted
   as numbers. For example a user name of the form '1e2' could have been converted into
   the number 100, then used as the string '100'.</p>

<p>Fixed several bugs in the session recovery mechanism:
   </p><ul>
   <li>Fixed a bug which could have caused, in case of a recovery failure
   due to the elapsing of the recently added "SessionRecoveryTimeout" setting, 
   the failure of the first subsequent attempt to create a new session.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug causing the client to always try a recovery when the ReconnectTimeout
   expired on a stalled session, regardless that the SessionRecoveryTimeout could be set
   as 0 to disable session recovery.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug that could have caused the silent discarding of control requests (e.g. subscriptions
   or messages) when the client was attempting the recovery of the current session.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug that could have caused session recovery to fail if preceded by a previous
   successful session recovery on the same session by more than a few seconds.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug triggered by a call to connect() or setForcedTransport() issued while the client
   was attempting the recovery of the current session. This caused the recovery to fail,
   but, then, the library might not reissue the current subscriptions on the newly created session.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Fixed a bug due to a race condition between a subscribe and a concurrent disconnect,
   which could have caused the subscription to be skipped upon a subsequent connect.</p>

<p>Modified the implementation of connect() when issued while the state is either
   DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY. The call will no longer interrupt
   the pending reconnection attempt, but it will be ignored, to lean on the current attempt.
   Note that a pending reconnection attempt can still be interrupted by issuing disconnect() first.<br/>
   Modified in a similar way the implementation of setForcedTransport(); when issued
   while the state is either DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   the call will no longer interrupt the pending reconnection attempt, but it will apply
   to the outcome of that connection attempt.</p>

<p>Wholly revised the policy of reconnection attempts upon failed or unresponsive requests.
   Now the only property related with this policy is "RetryDelay", which now affects both
   (1) the minimum time to wait before trying a new connection to the Server in case the previous one failed 
   for any reason and (2) the maximum time to wait for a response to a request before dropping the connection 
   and trying with a different approach.<br/>
   Previously, point (2) was related with the "ConnectTimeout" and "CurrentConnectTimeout" properties.
   Now, in case of multiple failed attempts on unresponsive connections (i.e. while in CONNECTING state),
   the timeout used may still be increased dynamically and can still be inspected through
   getCurrentConnectTimeout, but this behavior is no longer configurable.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that tries to take control of the
   connection timeouts will no longer be obeyed, but we assume that the new policy will bring
   an overall improvement. Note that, when in CONNECTING state, the current timeout can be restored
   by issuing disconnect() and then connect().</span>
   As a result of the change, methods setConnectTimeout, getConnectTimeout and setCurrentConnectTimeout 
   of ConnectionOptions have been deprecated, as the setters have no effect and the getter
   is now equivalent to getRetryDelay.<br/>
   Also changed the default value of the "RetryDelay" property from 2 seconds to 4 seconds.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the "EarlyWSOpenEnabled" property from true to false 
   (see ConnectionOptions.setEarlyWSOpenEnabled). This removes a potential incompatibility
   with cookie-based Load Balancers, at the expense of a possible slight delay in session startup.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the "SlowingEnabled" property from true to false 
   (see ConnectionOptions.setSlowingEnabled).</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Incremented the minor version number.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running the Server with a license
   of "file" type which enables Node.js Client SDK up to version 7.2 or earlier, clients based

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 7 Jun 2018</div></span>

<p>Introduced a maximum time on attempts to recover the current session, after which
   a new session will be opened. The default is 15 seconds, but it can be customized
   with the newly added "SessionRecoveryTimeout" property in ConnectionOptions.
   This fixes a potential case of permanently unsuccessful recovery, if the
   &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting were leveraged in a Server cluster and a Server
   instance happened to leave a cluster and were not automatically restarted.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism triggered
   by the use of the &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting on the Server,
   which could have caused feasible recovery attempts to fail.</p>

<p>Fixed a harmless bug, introduced in the previous version, which could have caused
   a Server warning for "duplicated LS_session" on some client requests.</p>


<div class="version">7.2.3 build 1750</div>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 17 Apr 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, by which,
   a sendMessage request issued while a recovery operation was in place,
   could have never been notified to the listener until the end of the session
   (at which point an "abort" notification would have been issued to the listener),
   even in case the recovery was successful.</p>

<p>Fixed a race condition, mostly possible while a session recovery was being
   attempted, which could have caused the delay of subscription requests
   due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Addressed a particular case of session interruption that was still not supported
   by the session recovery feature.</p>


<div class="version">7.2.2 build 1747</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 23 Mar 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed a severe bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, by which,
   after the creation of a new session because of network issues, it was possible
   that subsequent successful session recovery would cause data loss.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, which,
   upon particular kinds of network issues and if the creation of a new session
   had been necessary, could have caused the client to skip the resuming of the
   active subscriptions.</p>

<p>Fixed an annoying typo in the documentation of onStatusChange regarding the
   "DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY" status.</p> 

<p>Improved the library log by splitting the "lightstreamer.subscriptions" category in three,
   with the introduction of "lightstreamer.messages" and "lightstreamer.requests".
   See setLoggerProvider in LightstreamerClient for details.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that collects log
   from the "lightstreamer.subscriptions" category should be ported. This obviously
   is not expected to affect production code.</span></p>


<div class="version">7.2.1 build 1745</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 22 Feb 2018</div></span>

<p>Modified the default value of the "RetryDelay" property from 5000 to 2000 ms.
   This should help recovering from network outages of a few seconds, typical, for
   instance, of wifi/mobile network switches on mobile phones.</p>

<p>Extended the recovery mechanism to stalled sessions. Now, when the ReconnectTimeout
   expires, an attempt to recover the current session will be performed first.</p>

<p>Fixed a race condition, introduced in the previous build 1737, which could have caused
   the delay of subscription requests issued on a websocket session startup
   due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Improved the notification of closed sessions to the Server.</p>


<div class="version">7.2.0 build 1743</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Dec 2017</div></span>

<p>Changed the internal folder from sdk_client_node_unified to sdk_client_node.</p>

<p>Added automatic recovery of sessions upon unexpected socket interruption during
   streaming or long polling. Now the library will perform an attempt to resume
   the session from the interruption point. The attempt may or may not succeed,
   also depending on the Server configuration of the recovery capability.<br/>
   As a consequence, introduced a new status, namely DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   to inform the application when a recovery attempt is being performed; hence,
   onStatusChange and getStatus can provide the new status.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that uses the status
   names received via onStatusChange or getStatus may have to be aligned.</span></p>
   
<p>Extended the reverse heartbeat mechanism, governed by the "ReverseHeartbeatInterval"
   property. Now, it will also allow the Server to detect when a client has abandoned
   a session although the socket remains open.<br/>
   Fixed a bug on sending reverse heartbeats to the Server, which, sometimes, could
   have caused the Server to report a syntax error.</p>

<p>Added the new Server error code 71 to onServerError and clarified the difference
   with error code 60.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of the "ContentLength", "KeepaliveInterval", and
   "ReverseHeartbeatInterval" properties of ConnectionOptions, to clarify that
   a zero value is not allowed in the first and it is allowed in the others.</p>

<p>Improved subscription requests on WebSockets by removing unnecessary parts.</p>

<p>Aligned the documentation to comply with current licensing policies.</p>

<p>Fixed the recently added support for cookie handling on WebSocket connections,
   to be fully compliant in the determination of outgoing cookies.</p>

<p>Added static methods addCookies and getCookies to LightstreamerClient,
   to simplify the sharing of cookies between Server connections operated by
   the SDK library and the rest of the application.</p>

<p>Improved the handling of cookies, by adding support of the WebSocket case.
   Now, the invocation of setCookieHandlingRequired(true) no longer causes the
   library to keep from using WebSockets.<br/>
   Clarified in the docs for setHttpExtraHeaders how custom cookies can be set
   and inquired, which is also how cookies set by other sites can be supplied.</p>

<p>Added the error code 60 to "onServerError", to report cases in which the
   Server license does not allow the client version.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the recovery of control requests upon session close and replacement,
   which, through a rare race condition, could have caused the block of all subsequent
   control requests.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which caused the invocations to the "setReconnectTimeout" method
   in ConnectionOptions to be ignored.</p>

<p>Removed the polyfill of the Promise, which is no longer needed, yet it might
   have caused compatibility issues in some environments.</p>

<p>Removed a restriction on field names that can be supplied to a Subscription object
   within a "field list"; names made by numbers are now allowed.
   Obviously, the final validation on field names is made by the Metadata Adapter.</p>


<div class="version">7.0.4 build 1717</div>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in version 6.1 which prevented the "slowing algorithm"
   (see setSlowingEnabled) from working.</p>

<p>Fixed the handling of wrong calls to getFields and getFieldSchema on Subscription.
   In some cases, an exception different from the IllegalStateException was thrown.</p>

<p>Fixed the log produced by the library, as, between the window name (when available)
   and the timestamp a space was missing.</p>

<p>Revised the sendMessage implementation in the HTTP case, to limit recovery actions
   when messages are not to be ordered and a listener is not provided.<br/>
   Revised sendMessage to accept 0 as a legal value for the "delayTimeout" argument.</p>

<p>Revised the default setting for the "ContentLength" property of ConnectionOptions,
   to allow the library to set it to the best value.</p>

<p>Clarified in the documentation the meaning of null in setRequestedMaxFrequency
   and setRequestedBufferSize. Extended setRequestedMaxFrequency to allow the setting
   also when the subscription is "active" and the current value is null.</p>

<p>Revised the documentation of possible subscription error codes.</p>

<p>Added clarification details in the documentation of setCookieHandlingRequired.</p>


<div class="version">7.0.3 build 1712</div>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 10 May 2016</div></span>

<p>Introduced the new Node.js SDK. See the "sdk_client_nodejs_unified" folder.<br/>
   Previously, the Node.js library was available as part of the SDK for JavaScript Clients,
   now called SDK for Web Clients (Unified API).<br/>
   Note that the library was released in two different versions: as a "flavour" of the
   JavaScript Client Library and through the npm service. This SDK only refers to the library
   deployed via npm. However, currently, the use of the Web (Unified API) Client Library in the
   Node.js flavour, which is based on AMD, is not recommended.<br/>
   The Client Library has the same characteristics of the library in the current
   SDK for Web Clients (Unified API) version 7.0.2 and you can refer to that SDK for the
   changelog with respect to previous versions (although some topics in that changelog,
   obviously, don't pertain to Node.js), with the following additions:
   </p><ul>
   <li class="notInAMS">There is no licensing restriction on the library version
   in use when a license file is configured on the Server. But note that if trying to access
   a Server with Server version earlier than 6.0.2 a license error will be issued by the Server.</li>
   <li>Methods enableSharing and isMaster for the LightstreamerClient class are not available.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code targeted for the Node.js
   environment was not expected to request connection sharing, which is not supported there.</span></li>
   <li>Some dependency third-party libraries have been upgraded.</li>
   <li>Requests in HTTP now support cookie handling also in the Node.js environment.
   As a consequence, invocations of setCookieHandlingRequired(true) in class ConnectionOptions
   are now allowed, although they would disable the use of WebSocket, for which cookie handling
   is still not implemented.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Added a onClearSnapshot callback to the FlashTable.

on the Adapter side for one of the items in the table (provided that they are subscribed
to in DISTINCT or COMMAND mode) with the request to accomplish the specified action.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code will keep

   Ported the included demos to the new JavaScript Client SDK library.
   Note that the "commons" directory is no longer used to bring configuration code and
   imported JavaScript library code, which is now all included in the demo directory.</p>

<p>Removed the "javascript bridge" part of the SDK library, lsflashbridge.js, which is
   no longer needed with the new JavaScript Client SDK library. This also removes the strict
   dependency of each library build from a specific build of the underlying library,
   which was the case with the old HTML Client SDK library.</p>

<p>Changed the behavior of the onStatusChange callback; as a consequence of the required
   change of the underlying Client SDK library, the callback now returns new status indicators.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: existing code making use of the values
   returned by the onStatusChange callback should be wholly revised, by referring to the

<div class="version">4.1.0 build 76</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 14 Mar 2019</div>

<p>Wholly revised the policy of reconnection attempts upon failed or unresponsive requests.
   Now the only property related with this policy is <code>retryDelay</code>, which now affects both
   (1) the minimum time to wait before trying a new connection to the Server in case the previous one failed
   for any reason and (2) the maximum time to wait for a response to a request before dropping the connection
   and trying with a different approach.<br/>
   Previously, point (2) was related with the <code>connectTimeout</code> and <code>currentConnectTimeout</code> properties.
   Now, in case of multiple failed attempts on unresponsive connections (i.e. while in CONNECTING state),
   the timeout used may still be increased dynamically and can be inspected through <code>currentConnectTimeout</code>,
   but this behavior is no longer configurable.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that tries to take control of the
   connection timeouts will no longer be obeyed, but we assume that the new policy will bring
   an overall improvement. Note that, when in CONNECTING state, the current timeout can be restored
   by issuing <code>disconnect</code>> and then <code>connect</code>.</span>
   As a result of the change, properties <code>connectTimeout</code> and <code>currentConnectTimeout</code>
   of <code>LSConnectionOptions</code> have been deprecated, as the setters have no effect and the getter
   is now equivalent to <code>retryDelay</code>.<br/>
   Also changed the default value of the <code>retryDelay</code> property from 2 seconds to 4 seconds.</p>

<p>Modified the implementation of <code>connect</code> when issued while the state is either
   DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY. The call will no longer interrupt
   the pending reconnection attempt, but it will be ignored, to lean on the current attempt.
   Note that a pending reconnection attempt can still be interrupted by issuing </code>disconnect</code> first.<br/>
   Modified in a similar way the implementation of <code>forcedTransport</code> property when issued
   while the state is either DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   the call will no longer interrupt the pending reconnection attempt, but it will apply
   to the outcome of that connection attempt.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug triggered by a call to <code>connect</code> or a change to <code>forcedTransport</code> issued while the client
   was attempting the recovery of the current session. This caused the recovery to fail,
   but, then, the library might not reissue the current subscriptions on the newly created session.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that could have caused session recovery to fail if preceded by a previous
   successful session recovery on the same session by more than a few seconds.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the <code>earlyWSOpenEnabled</code> property from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code>.
   This removes a potential incompatibility with cookie-based Load Balancers,
   at the expense of a possible slight delay in session startup.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the <code>slowingEnabled</code> property from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code>.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Incremented the minor version number.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running the Server with a license
   of "file" type which enables iOS Client SDK up to version 4.0 or earlier, clients based
   on this new version will not be accepted by the Server: a license upgrade will be needed.</span></p>


<div class="version">4.0.5 build 75</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Nov 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed a race condition that could lead the client to stop trying to reconnect
   to the server after a network disconnection or a server restart. This bug has
   been reported only when running on the Simulator, but could happen also on
   the device.</p>


<div class="version">4.0.4 build 74</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 30 Oct 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug causing a fatal error when the client recreated a session because
   of a network error and there were active MPN subscriptions.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug causing the client to ignore the <code>sessionRecoveryTimeout</code>
   when in state STALLED.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug causing the closing of the session when the user made a copy
   of a triggered <code>LSMPNSubscription</code> (with the copy constructor
   <code>initWithMPNSubscription:</code>) and then subscribed the copy.</p>


<div class="version">4.0.3 build 72</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 10 Jul 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed reference cycles that could lead to memory leaks while trying to connect
   for extended periods of time or, once connected, when subscribing and unsubscribing
   multiple times.</p>


<div class="version">4.0.2 build 70</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 31 May 2018</div></span>

<p>Introduced a maximum time on attempts to recover the current session, after which
   a new session will be opened. The default is 15 seconds, but it can be customized
   with the newly added <code>sessionRecoveryTimeout</code> property in <code>LSConnectionOptions</code>.
   This fixes a potential case of permanently unsuccessful recovery, if the
   &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting were leveraged in a Server cluster and a Server
   instance happened to leave a cluster and were not automatically restarted.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism triggered
   by the use of the &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting on the Server,
   which could have caused feasible recovery attempts to fail.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the Stream-Sense mechanism, which was unable to recover to HTTP
   streaming in some specific cases of unavailability of a websocket connection.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug  affecting the interruption of a session on a WebSocket.
   In case of connectivity issues (or cluster affinity issues) the session might
   have remained open in the background, causing a resource waste.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, by which,
   a "sendMessage" request issued while a recovery operation was in place,
   could have never been notified to the listener until the end of the session
   (at which point an "abort" notification would have been issued to the listener),
   even in case the recovery was successful.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which, upon particular kinds of network issues and when the "early websocket open"
   feature was enabled, could have caused the client to abort session establishment or recovery
   attempts with no notification to the application.</p>

<p>Minor performance improvement in native HTTP connection mechanism by replacing threads with 
   GCD queues</p>


<div class="version">4.0.1 build 69</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 26 Feb 2018</div></span>

<p>Added the error code 21 in <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>,
   that can be received upon some failed requests, to inform that not only the current
   session was not found but it is also likely that the request was routed to the wrong
   Server instance. Previously, in the same cases, the SDK library would not invoke
   <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code> and would open a new session instead.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If using an existing application, you should
   check how it would handle the new (and unexpected) error code. A reconnection attempt would
   ensure the previous behavior, although this is no longer the suggested action.</span></p>

<p>Modified the default value of the <code>retryDelay</code> property from 5 to 2 seconds.
   This should help recovering from network outages of a few seconds, typical, for
   instance, of wifi/mobile network switches.</p>

<p>Extended the recovery mechanism to stalled sessions. Now, when the <code>reconnectTimeout</code>
   expires, an attempt to recover the current session will be performed first.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in version 3.0.0, which could have caused the property <code>snapshot</code>
   of <code>LSItemUpdate</code> to behave wrongly on subscriptions in which the snapshot
   was not requested.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced with version 3.0.0 preventing the connection when the Server
   configuration specifies a control-link address.</p>

<p>Fixed a rare race condition which could have caused the delay of subscription
   requests issued on a websocket session startup due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which, in a slow client scenario, could have caused the interruption
   of a polling session due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Fixed a race condition, mostly possible in an overloaded client scenario, which
   could have caused subscription or sendMessage requests to be delayed.</p>

<p>Fixed a harmless bug in the reverse heartbeat mechanism  which, upon session startup,
   could have caused an exception to be logged on the console.</p>

<p>Fixed the instructions provided in the documentation of <code>notificationFormat</code>
   property of the <code>LSMPNSubscription</code> class.</p>

<p>Extended the scope of error code 41 on the various MPN requests to all issues related
   with resource unavailability in the Server preventing the operation. Previously,
   such issues could have caused the whole session to be interrupted.</p>

<p>Added clarifications on licensing matters in the docs.</p>


<div class="version">4.0.0 build 66</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Dec 2017</div></span>

<p>Changed the internal folder from sdk_client_ios_unified to sdk_client_ios.</p>

<p>Introduced the support for Mobile Push Notifications. It consists in
   new methods in the <code>LSLightstreamerClient</code> class together with new dedicated
   classes. See the API documentation for details.<br/>
   An MPN subscription is backed by a real-time subscription, from which it may take
   any field value. Unlike the usual real-time subscriptions, MPN subscriptions are persistent:
   they survive the session and are identified by a permanent, global, unique key provided
   by the Server at time of activation.<br/>
   The notifications are managed by third-party services supported by the Server,
   which determine the notification characteristics and the supported devices.<br/>
   <span class="notInAPV">However, the support for Mobile Push Notifications
   by Lightstreamer Server (i.e. the MPN Module) is not available with this edition.</span></p>

<p>Added automatic recovery of sessions upon unexpected socket interruption during
   streaming or long polling. Now the library will perform an attempt to resume
   the session from the interruption point. The attempt may or may not succeed,
   also depending on the Server configuration of the recovery capability.<br/>
   As a consequence, introduced a new status, namely DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   to inform the application when a recovery attempt is being performed; hence,
   <code>client:didChangeStatus:</code> event and the <status>status</code> property can
   provide the new status.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that uses the status
   names received via <code>client:didChangeStatus:</code> or <status>status</code> may
   have to be aligned.</span></p>

<p>Extended the reverse heartbeat mechanism, governed by the <code>reverseHeartbeatInterval</code>
   property. Now, it will also allow the Server to detect when a client has abandoned
   a session although the socket remains open.<br/>
   Fixed the reverse heartbeat mechanism, which didn't work at all. Since version 3.0.0,
   setting a value for the <code>reverseHeartbeatInterval</code> property could have even
   caused the connection interruption.</p>

<p>Added the new Server error code 71 to <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>
   and clarified the difference with error code 60.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that, when under certain circumstances the server is unreachable,
   caused the client to enter in a tight reconnection loop ignoring the parameter <code>retryDelay</code>
   property of <code>LSConnectionOptions</code>.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in version 3, affecting the case of session establishment
   refusal by the Metadata Adapter (through a CreditsException) and the case of forced
   destroy (via external requests), when a negative custom error code was supplied.
   The subsequent invocation to <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>
   would carry code 61 (internal error) instead of the specified custom code.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which caused polling on WebSocket to fail. Note that this feature
   is available, but very rarely used.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of <code>serverSocketName</code> property, whose behavior has slightly
   changed since version 3.0.0.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of the <code>contentLength</code>, <code>keepaliveInterval</code>,
   and <code>reverseHeartbeatInterval</code> properties of <code>LSConnectionOptions</code>,
   to clarify that a zero value is not allowed in the first and it is allowed in the others.</p>

<p>Aligned the documentation to comply with current licensing policies.</p>


<div class="version">3.0.1 build 55.10</div>

<div class="version">3.0.0 beta build 55.7</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.1</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Made available as a prerelease on 19 Jul 2017</div></span>

<p>Introduced the use of WebSockets both for streaming and for subscription
   and client message requests, which brings an overall performance improvement.<br/>
   As a consequence, <code>forcedTransport</code> now also supports the "WS", "WS-STREAMING",
   and "WS-POLLING" values and the predisposed <code>earlyWSOpenEnabled</code> property
   is now effective.<br/>
   WebSocket support is provided by SocketRocket. Its license file is included in
   the distribution.</p>

<p>Added static methods <code>addCookies:forURL:</code> and <code>getCookiesForURL:</code>
   in LSLightstreamerClient, to allow for cookie sharing with the rest of the application
   when a local cookie store is being used.</p>

<p>Replaced the <code>maxBandwidth</code> property of LSConnectionOptions with two
   distinct properties: <code>requestedMaxBandwidth</code> and the read-only <code>realMaxBandwidth</code>,
   so that the setting is made with the former, while the value applied by
   the Server is only reported by the latter, now including changes during session
   life. The extension affects the property names and also the invocations
   of <code>client:didChangeProperty:</code> on the LSClientDelegate (see the docs for details).
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using <code>maxBandwidth</code>
   in any of the mentioned forms has to be ported and recompiled. If the property
   is not used in any form, existing compiled code can still run against the new
   library.</span></p>

<p>Introduced a new callback, <code>subscription:didReceiveRealFrequency:</code>,
   to the LSSubscriptionDelegate, to report the frequency constraint on the subscription as
   determined by the Server and their changes during subscription life. See the docs for details
   and special cases.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code has to be ported,
   by implementing the new method, and recompiled. Existing compiled code should
   still run against the new library: invocations to <code>subscription:didReceiveRealFrequency:</code>
   to the custom delegate would simply be ignored.</span></p>

<p>Introduced a new property, <code>clientIp</code>, in LSConnectionDetails;
   it is a read-only property with the keyword for <code>client:didChangeProperty:</code>
   (see the docs for details).</p>

<p>Completed the implementation of methods whose implementation was only partial.
   This regards:</p>
   <ul>
        <li><code>fieldSchema</code> in LSSubscription now also working for COMMAND mode subscriptions;</li>
        <li><code>slowingEnabled</code> in LSConnectionOptions now working if YES is supplied;</li>
        <li><code>subscription:didClearSnapshotForItemName:itemPos:</code> in the LSSubscriptionDelegate now invoked as expected.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Fixed the nullability annotations for the following methods and properties:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>LSClientDelegate:<ul>
       <li><code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code></li></ul>
   <li>LSClientMessageDelegate:<ul>
       <li><code>client:didDenyMessage:withCode:error:</code></li></ul>
   <li>LSLightstreamerClient:<ul>
       <li><code>setLoggerProvider:</code></li></ul>
   <li>LSSubscription:<ul>
       <li><code>commandSecondLevelFields</code></li>
       <li><code>commandSecondLevelFieldSchema</code></li>
       <li><code>fields</code></li>
       <li><code>fieldSchema</code></li>
       <li><code>itemGroup</code></li>
       <li><code>items</code></li></ul>
   </ul><p>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code written in Swift
   may no longer compile and should be aligned with the new signatures.
   No issues are expected for existing Objective-C code.</span></p>

<p>Revised the <code>sendMessage</code> implementation in the HTTP case, to limit recovery actions
   when messages are not to be ordered and a delegate is not provided.<br/>
   Revised <code>sendMessage</code> to accept 0 as a legal value for the <code>delayTimeout</code> argument;
   negative values will now be accepted to mean that the Server default timeout is to be used.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code using the 5-argument
   version of <code>sendMessage</code> and supplying 0 as <code>delayTimeout</code> must be modified to use
   -1 instead. Invocations to the 1-argument version don't have to be modified.</span></p>

<p>Fixed a bug which affected any unsubscription request issued so early
   that the corresponding subscription request had not been completed yet.
   Such unsubscription could have caused <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:</code> with code 19
   and the item would have been left subscribed to by the session on the Server,
   yet considered not subscribed to by the library.</p>

<p>Improved the efficiency by avoiding unnecessary encoding of characters in the
   requests (for instance, in group/schema names and in client messages).
   In particular, non-ascii characters are no longer encoded.</p>

<p>Improved the management of retries upon unsuccessful control requests.</p>

<p>Slightly delayed the availability of the <code>serverSocketName</code> property of
   LSConnectionDetails, which was already valued upon session start.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using
   <code>serverSocketName</code> right after a session start, should ensure that
   <code>client:didChangeProperty:</code> for <code>serverSocketName</code> gets invoked first.</span></p>

<p>Added the support for non standard unicode names, if supplied as hostnames
   in the Server's &lt;control_link_address&gt; configuration element.</p>

<p>Removed useless requests to the Server for bandwidth change when the Server
   is not configured for bandwidth management.</p>

<p>Improved the management of <code>HTTPExtraHeadersOnSessionCreationOnly</code>, when YES.
   Previously, the extra headers (supplied with <code>HTTPExtraHeaders</code>) were still
   sent, redundantly, on control requests.</p>

<p>Fully revised the documentation to be more readable from Xcode preview.<br/>
   Also switched to Appledoc for the generation of API docsets, for improved
   readability and conformance with other SDKs documentation.</p>

<p>Added new error codes 66 and 68 to <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>,
   <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:</code>, and
   <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:forCommandSecondLevelItemWithKey:</code>,
   to report server-side issues; previously, upon such problems, the connection was just interrupted.<br/>
   Added missing error code 60 to <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code> documentation;
   this error reports server-side licensing limitations.<br/>
   Removed error code 20 from <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:</code> and
   <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:forCommandSecondLevelItemWithKey:</code>
   documentation; when a subscription request cannot find the session,
   the session is just closed and recovered immediately.<br/>
   Revised the documentation of the possible error codes.</p>

<p>Clarified in the documentation the meaning of nil in <code>requestedMaxFrequency</code>
   and <code>requestedBufferSize</code>. Extended <code>requestedMaxFrequency</code> to allow the setting
   also when the subscription is "active" and the current value is nil.</p>


<div class="version">2.1.2 build 49</div>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 17 Jan 2017</div></span>

<p>Added the new setting <code>limitExceptionsUse</code> in LSLightstreamerClient to
   avoid throwing an exception when certain methods are called with an invalid parameter.
   E.g. <code>valueWithFieldName:</code> in LSItemUpdate and <code>valueWithItemName:fieldName:</code>
   in LSSubscription both obey to this new setting. See API docs for more information.</p>

<p>Removed a restriction on field names that can be supplied to a LSSubscription object
   within a "field list"; names made by numbers are now allowed.
   Obviously, the final validation on field names is made by the Metadata Adapter.</p>

<p>Moved the <code>LIB_NAME</code> and <code>LIB_VERSION</code> methods of LSLightstreamerClient to
   class properties. They can now be accessed with the dot notation. Previous class methods remain
   available.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the implementation of <code>disconnect</code>, whereby an ongoing loop
   of connection attempt was not interrupted in case of Server down or wrong address.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug, regarding only subscriptions in COMMAND mode,
   which caused unchanged fields to be redundantly indicated as changed.
   The bug didn't affect the returned data values.</p>

<p>Revised the default setting for the <code>contentLength</code> property of LSConnectionOptions,
   to allow the library to set it to the best value.</p>


<div class="version">2.1.0 build 45</div>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 25 Nov 2016</div></span>

<p>Added new properties to LSConnectionOptions and new behavior to LSLightstreamerClient to limit
   the number of sessions that can be concurrently open to the same Server. New properties are:
   <code>maxConcurrentSessionsPerServer</code> (a class property) and
   <code>maxConcurrentSessionsPerServerExceededPolicy</code>. See docs for more information.</p>

<p>Added new event to LSClientDelegate to respond to an authentication challenge raised during
   network connection. New event is <code>client:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge:</code>.
   See docs for more information.</p>

<p>Fixed bug that caused a crash if an LSSubscription object was created before initializing
   an LSLightstreamerClient instance.</p>

<p>Removed any remaining use of NSURLConnection. Now all networking is done through NSURLSession.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that could have caused wrong error codes (that is, codes different from the documented ones)
   to be reported by subscription error events of LSSubscriptionDelegate.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of <code>subscription:didClearSnapshotForItemName:itemPos:</code> on
   LSSubscriptionDelegate, which is only predisposed.</p>

<p>The client library is now distributed as a framework.</p>

<p>Raised the minimum iOS version requirements to 8.0.</p>

<p>Fixed a memory leak that could become significant with intense update activity.</p>

<p>Fixed bug in network reachability thread that caused a 100% CPU usage if the client
   was initialized but left unconnected.</p>

<p>Clarified the documentation in regard to a few API methods that still have
   a partial implementation or are just predisposed and not implemented yet.</p>


<div class="version">2.0.0 build 33</div>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 8 Apr 2016</div></span>

<p>Included in Lightstreamer distribution package. See "sdk_client_ios_unified".</p>

<p>Added bitcode support.</p>

<p>Fixed casing of property "sessionID" of LSConnectionDetails as "sessionId",
for coherence with other Unified Client APIs.</p>

<p>Event <code>client:didChangeProperty:</code> now reports correct iOS client
property names, e.g. "pollingTimeout" instead of "pollingMillis".</p>

<p>Fixed potential exception which could be thrown when setting or updating
fields and/or items list if logging is enabled at DEBUG level.
</p>

<p>Prevented reconnection attempts upon wrong answers from the Server.</p>

<p>Fixed an error in the log of the keepalive interval setting.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>
and <code>client:didChangeStatus:</code>, to specify that the former
is always preceded, not followed, by the latter with DISCONNECTED.</p>


<div class="version">2.0 a5 build 27</div>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Made available as a prerelease on 17 Nov 2015</div></span>

<p>Changed the type and behavior of connectTimeout. This setting is now
represented as a String in order to accept the "auto" value. If "auto" is
specified the value used internally will be chosen (and possibly changed over
time) by the library itself. Note that "auto" is also the new default value.
To check and or modify the current value a property is exposed:
currentConnectTimeout.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: if the connectTimeout
property is changed by the client code, the given parameter must be modified
to be a String. If the connectTimeout property is accesses by the client code
its receiving variable must be converted to an NSString; moreover it is
likely that connectTimeout accesses should be replaced by
currentConnectTimeout ones.</span>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.1</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Made available as a prerelease on 7 Oct 2015</div></span>

<p>Introduced as an improved alternative to the SDK for iOS clients. The
   interface offered is completely different, and it is very similar to the

<div class="version">4.1.0 build 66</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 14 Mar 2019</div>

<p>Wholly revised the policy of reconnection attempts upon failed or unresponsive requests.
   Now the only property related with this policy is <code>retryDelay</code>, which now affects both
   (1) the minimum time to wait before trying a new connection to the Server in case the previous one failed
   for any reason and (2) the maximum time to wait for a response to a request before dropping the connection
   and trying with a different approach.<br/>
   Previously, point (2) was related with the <code>connectTimeout</code> and <code>currentConnectTimeout</code> properties.
   Now, in case of multiple failed attempts on unresponsive connections (i.e. while in CONNECTING state),
   the timeout used may still be increased dynamically and can be inspected through <code>currentConnectTimeout</code>,
   but this behavior is no longer configurable.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that tries to take control of the
   connection timeouts will no longer be obeyed, but we assume that the new policy will bring
   an overall improvement. Note that, when in CONNECTING state, the current timeout can be restored
   by issuing <code>disconnect</code>> and then <code>connect</code>.</span>
   As a result of the change, properties <code>connectTimeout</code> and <code>currentConnectTimeout</code>
   of <code>LSConnectionOptions</code> have been deprecated, as the setters have no effect and the getter
   is now equivalent to <code>retryDelay</code>.<br/>
   Also changed the default value of the <code>retryDelay</code> property from 2 seconds to 4 seconds.</p>

<p>Modified the implementation of <code>connect</code> when issued while the state is either
   DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY. The call will no longer interrupt
   the pending reconnection attempt, but it will be ignored, to lean on the current attempt.
   Note that a pending reconnection attempt can still be interrupted by issuing </code>disconnect</code> first.<br/>
   Modified in a similar way the implementation of <code>forcedTransport</code> property when issued
   while the state is either DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   the call will no longer interrupt the pending reconnection attempt, but it will apply
   to the outcome of that connection attempt.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug triggered by a call to <code>connect</code> or a change to <code>forcedTransport</code> issued while the client
   was attempting the recovery of the current session. This caused the recovery to fail,
   but, then, the library might not reissue the current subscriptions on the newly created session.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that could have caused session recovery to fail if preceded by a previous
   successful session recovery on the same session by more than a few seconds.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the <code>earlyWSOpenEnabled</code> property from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code>.
   This removes a potential incompatibility with cookie-based Load Balancers,
   at the expense of a possible slight delay in session startup.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the <code>slowingEnabled</code> property from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code>.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Incremented the minor version number.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running the Server with a license
   of "file" type which enables macOS Client SDK up to version 4.0 or earlier, clients based
   on this new version will not be accepted by the Server: a license upgrade will be needed.</span></p>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Nov 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed a race condition that could lead the client to stop trying to reconnect
   to the server after a network disconnection or a server restart. This bug has
   been reported only when running on the Simulator, but could happen also on
   the device.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug causing a fatal error when the client recreated a session because
   of a network error and there were active MPN subscriptions.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug causing the client to ignore the <code>sessionRecoveryTimeout</code>
   when in state STALLED.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug causing the closing of the session when the user made a copy
   of a triggered <code>LSMPNSubscription</code> (with the copy constructor
   <code>initWithMPNSubscription:</code>) and then subscribed the copy.</p>

<p>Fixed reference cycles that could lead to memory leaks while trying to connect
   for extended periods of time or, once connected, when subscribing and unsubscribing
   multiple times.</p>


<div class="version">4.0.2 build 60</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 31 May 2018</div></span>

<p>Raised minimum macOS version requirement to 10.10, from 10.9.</p>

<p>Introduced a maximum time on attempts to recover the current session, after which
   a new session will be opened. The default is 15 seconds, but it can be customized
   with the newly added <code>sessionRecoveryTimeout</code> property in <code>LSConnectionOptions</code>.
   This fixes a potential case of permanently unsuccessful recovery, if the
   &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting were leveraged in a Server cluster and a Server
   instance happened to leave a cluster and were not automatically restarted.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism triggered
   by the use of the &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting on the Server,
   which could have caused feasible recovery attempts to fail.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the Stream-Sense mechanism, which was unable to recover to HTTP
   streaming in some specific cases of unavailability of a websocket connection.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug  affecting the interruption of a session on a WebSocket.
   In case of connectivity issues (or cluster affinity issues) the session might
   have remained open in the background, causing a resource waste.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, by which,
   a "sendMessage" request issued while a recovery operation was in place,
   could have never been notified to the listener until the end of the session
   (at which point an "abort" notification would have been issued to the listener),
   even in case the recovery was successful.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which, upon particular kinds of network issues and when the "early websocket open"
   feature was enabled, could have caused the client to abort session establishment or recovery
   attempts with no notification to the application.</p>

<p>Minor performance improvement in native HTTP connection mechanism by replacing threads with 
   GCD queues</p>


<div class="version">4.0.1 build 58</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 26 Feb 2018</div></span>

<p>Added the error code 21 in <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>,
   that can be received upon some failed requests, to inform that not only the current
   session was not found but it is also likely that the request was routed to the wrong
   Server instance. Previously, in the same cases, the SDK library would not invoke
   <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code> and would open a new session instead.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If using an existing application, you should
   check how it would handle the new (and unexpected) error code. A reconnection attempt would
   ensure the previous behavior, although this is no longer the suggested action.</span></p>

<p>Modified the default value of the <code>retryDelay</code> property from 5 to 2 seconds.
   This should help recovering from network outages of a few seconds, typical, for
   instance, of wifi/mobile network switches.</p>

<p>Extended the recovery mechanism to stalled sessions. Now, when the <code>reconnectTimeout</code>
   expires, an attempt to recover the current session will be performed first.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in version 3.0.0, which could have caused the property <code>snapshot</code>
   of <code>LSItemUpdate</code> to behave wrongly on subscriptions in which the snapshot
   was not requested.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced with version 3.0.0 preventing the connection when the Server
   configuration specifies a control-link address.</p>

<p>Fixed a rare race condition which could have caused the delay of subscription
   requests issued on a websocket session startup due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which, in a slow client scenario, could have caused the interruption
   of a polling session due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Fixed a race condition, mostly possible in an overloaded client scenario, which
   could have caused subscription or sendMessage requests to be delayed.</p>

<p>Fixed a harmless bug in the reverse heartbeat mechanism  which, upon session startup,
   could have caused an exception to be logged on the console.</p>

<p>Fixed the instructions provided in the documentation of <code>notificationFormat</code>
   property of the <code>LSMPNSubscription</code> class.</p>

<p>Extended the scope of error code 41 on the various MPN requests to all issues related
   with resource unavailability in the Server preventing the operation. Previously,
   such issues could have caused the whole session to be interrupted.</p>

<p>Added clarifications on licensing matters in the docs.</p>


<div class="version">4.0.0 build 55</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Dec 2017</div></span>

<p>Changed the internal folder from sdk_client_macos_unified to sdk_client_macos.</p>

<p>Introduced the support for Mobile Push Notifications. It consists in
   new methods in the <code>LSLightstreamerClient</code> class together with new dedicated
   classes. See the API documentation for details.<br/>
   An MPN subscription is backed by a real-time subscription, from which it may take
   any field value. Unlike the usual real-time subscriptions, MPN subscriptions are persistent:
   they survive the session and are identified by a permanent, global, unique key provided
   by the Server at time of activation.<br/>
   The notifications are managed by third-party services supported by the Server,
   which determine the notification characteristics and the supported devices.<br/>
   <span class="notInAPV">However, the support for Mobile Push Notifications
   by Lightstreamer Server (i.e. the MPN Module) is not available with this edition.</span></p>

<p>Added automatic recovery of sessions upon unexpected socket interruption during
   streaming or long polling. Now the library will perform an attempt to resume
   the session from the interruption point. The attempt may or may not succeed,
   also depending on the Server configuration of the recovery capability.<br/>
   As a consequence, introduced a new status, namely DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   to inform the application when a recovery attempt is being performed; hence,
   <code>client:didChangeStatus:</code> event and the <status>status</code> property can
   provide the new status.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that uses the status
   names received via <code>client:didChangeStatus:</code> or <status>status</code> may
   have to be aligned.</span></p>

<p>Extended the reverse heartbeat mechanism, governed by the <code>reverseHeartbeatInterval</code>
   property. Now, it will also allow the Server to detect when a client has abandoned
   a session although the socket remains open.<br/>
   Fixed the reverse heartbeat mechanism, which didn't work at all. Since version 3.0.0,
   setting a value for the <code>reverseHeartbeatInterval</code> property could have even
   caused the connection interruption.</p>

<p>Added the new Server error code 71 to <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>
   and clarified the difference with error code 60.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that, when under certain circumstances the server is unreachable,
   caused the client to enter in a tight reconnection loop ignoring the parameter <code>retryDelay</code>
   property of <code>LSConnectionOptions</code>.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in version 3, affecting the case of session establishment
   refusal by the Metadata Adapter (through a CreditsException) and the case of forced
   destroy (via external requests), when a negative custom error code was supplied.
   The subsequent invocation to <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>
   would carry code 61 (internal error) instead of the specified custom code.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which caused polling on WebSocket to fail. Note that this feature
   is available, but very rarely used.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of <code>serverSocketName</code> property, whose behavior has slightly
   changed since version 3.0.0.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of the <code>contentLength</code>, <code>keepaliveInterval</code>,
   and <code>reverseHeartbeatInterval</code> properties of <code>LSConnectionOptions</code>,
   to clarify that a zero value is not allowed in the first and it is allowed in the others.</p>

<p>Aligned the documentation to comply with current licensing policies.</p>


<div class="version">3.0.1 build 46.11</div>

<div class="version">3.0.0 beta build 46.8</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.1</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Made available as a prerelease on 19 Jul 2017</div></span>

<p>Introduced the use of WebSockets both for streaming and for subscription
   and client message requests, which brings an overall performance improvement.<br/>
   As a consequence, <code>forcedTransport</code> now also supports the "WS", "WS-STREAMING",
   and "WS-POLLING" values and the predisposed <code>earlyWSOpenEnabled</code> property
   is now effective.<br/>
   WebSocket support is provided by SocketRocket. Its license file is included in
   the distribution.</p>

<p>Added static methods <code>addCookies:forURL:</code> and <code>getCookiesForURL:</code>
   in LSLightstreamerClient, to allow for cookie sharing with the rest of the application
   when a local cookie store is being used.</p>

<p>Replaced the <code>maxBandwidth</code> property of LSConnectionOptions with two
   distinct properties: <code>requestedMaxBandwidth</code> and the read-only <code>realMaxBandwidth</code>,
   so that the setting is made with the former, while the value applied by
   the Server is only reported by the latter, now including changes during session
   life. The extension affects the property names and also the invocations
   of <code>client:didChangeProperty:</code> on the LSClientDelegate (see the docs for details).
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using <code>maxBandwidth</code>
   in any of the mentioned forms has to be ported and recompiled. If the property
   is not used in any form, existing compiled code can still run against the new
   library.</span></p>

<p>Introduced a new callback, <code>subscription:didReceiveRealFrequency:</code>,
   to the LSSubscriptionDelegate, to report the frequency constraint on the subscription as
   determined by the Server and their changes during subscription life. See the docs for details
   and special cases.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code has to be ported,
   by implementing the new method, and recompiled. Existing compiled code should
   still run against the new library: invocations to <code>subscription:didReceiveRealFrequency:</code>
   to the custom delegate would simply be ignored.</span></p>

<p>Introduced a new property, <code>clientIp</code>, in LSConnectionDetails;
   it is a read-only property with the keyword for <code>client:didChangeProperty:</code>
   (see the docs for details).</p>

<p>Completed the implementation of methods whose implementation was only partial.
   This regards:</p>
   <ul>
        <li><code>fieldSchema</code> in LSSubscription now also working for COMMAND mode subscriptions;</li>
        <li><code>slowingEnabled</code> in LSConnectionOptions now working if YES is supplied;</li>
        <li><code>subscription:didClearSnapshotForItemName:itemPos:</code> in the LSSubscriptionDelegate now invoked as expected.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Fixed the nullability annotations for the following methods and properties:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>LSClientDelegate:<ul>
       <li><code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code></li></ul>
   <li>LSClientMessageDelegate:<ul>
       <li><code>client:didDenyMessage:withCode:error:</code></li></ul>
   <li>LSLightstreamerClient:<ul>
       <li><code>setLoggerProvider:</code></li></ul>
   <li>LSSubscription:<ul>
       <li><code>commandSecondLevelFields</code></li>
       <li><code>commandSecondLevelFieldSchema</code></li>
       <li><code>fields</code></li>
       <li><code>fieldSchema</code></li>
       <li><code>itemGroup</code></li>
       <li><code>items</code></li></ul>
   </ul><p>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code written in Swift
   may no longer compile and should be aligned with the new signatures.
   No issues are expected for existing Objective-C code.</span></p>

<p>Revised the <code>sendMessage</code> implementation in the HTTP case, to limit recovery actions
   when messages are not to be ordered and a delegate is not provided.<br/>
   Revised <code>sendMessage</code> to accept 0 as a legal value for the <code>delayTimeout</code> argument;
   negative values will now be accepted to mean that the Server default timeout is to be used.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code using the 5-argument
   version of <code>sendMessage</code> and supplying 0 as <code>delayTimeout</code> must be modified to use
   -1 instead. Invocations to the 1-argument version don't have to be modified.</span></p>

<p>Fixed a bug which affected any unsubscription request issued so early
   that the corresponding subscription request had not been completed yet.
   Such unsubscription could have caused <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:</code> with code 19
   and the item would have been left subscribed to by the session on the Server,
   yet considered not subscribed to by the library.</p>

<p>Improved the efficiency by avoiding unnecessary encoding of characters in the
   requests (for instance, in group/schema names and in client messages).
   In particular, non-ascii characters are no longer encoded.</p>

<p>Improved the management of retries upon unsuccessful control requests.</p>

<p>Slightly delayed the availability of the <code>serverSocketName</code> property of
   LSConnectionDetails, which was already valued upon session start.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using
   <code>serverSocketName</code> right after a session start, should ensure that
   <code>client:didChangeProperty:</code> for <code>serverSocketName</code> gets invoked first.</span></p>

<p>Added the support for non standard unicode names, if supplied as hostnames
   in the Server's &lt;control_link_address&gt; configuration element.</p>

<p>Removed useless requests to the Server for bandwidth change when the Server
   is not configured for bandwidth management.</p>

<p>Improved the management of <code>HTTPExtraHeadersOnSessionCreationOnly</code>, when YES.
   Previously, the extra headers (supplied with <code>HTTPExtraHeaders</code>) were still
   sent, redundantly, on control requests.</p>

<p>Fully revised the documentation to be more readable from Xcode preview.<br/>
   Also switched to Appledoc for the generation of API docsets, for improved
   readability and conformance with other SDKs documentation.</p>

<p>Added new error codes 66 and 68 to <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>,
   <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:</code>, and
   <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:forCommandSecondLevelItemWithKey:</code>,
   to report server-side issues; previously, upon such problems, the connection was just interrupted.<br/>
   Added missing error code 60 to <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code> documentation;
   this error reports server-side licensing limitations.<br/>
   Removed error code 20 from <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:</code> and
   <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:forCommandSecondLevelItemWithKey:</code>
   documentation; when a subscription request cannot find the session,
   the session is just closed and recovered immediately.<br/>
   Revised the documentation of the possible error codes.</p>

<p>Clarified in the documentation the meaning of nil in <code>requestedMaxFrequency</code>
   and <code>requestedBufferSize</code>. Extended <code>requestedMaxFrequency</code> to allow the setting
   also when the subscription is "active" and the current value is nil.</p>

<p>Aligned the <code>LIB_NAME</code> property to "macos"; it was still valued as "osx".</p>


<div class="version">2.1.2 build 43</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.1</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 17 Jan 2017</div></span>

<p>Added the new setting <code>limitExceptionsUse</code> in LSLightstreamerClient to
   avoid throwing an exception when certain methods are called with an invalid parameter.
   E.g. <code>valueWithFieldName:</code> in LSItemUpdate and <code>valueWithItemName:fieldName:</code>
   in LSSubscription both obey to this new setting. See API docs for more information.</p>

<p>Removed a restriction on field names that can be supplied to a LSSubscription object
   within a "field list"; names made by numbers are now allowed.
   Obviously, the final validation on field names is made by the Metadata Adapter.</p>

<p>Moved the <code>LIB_NAME</code> and <code>LIB_VERSION</code> methods of LSLightstreamerClient to
   class properties. They can now be accessed with the dot notation. Previous class methods remain
   available.</p>


<div class="version">2.1.1 build 41</div>

<p>Fixed a bug on the implementation of <code>disconnect</code>, whereby an ongoing loop
   of connection attempt was not interrupted in case of Server down or wrong address.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug, regarding only subscriptions in COMMAND mode,
   which caused unchanged fields to be redundantly indicated as changed.
   The bug didn't affect the returned data values.</p>

<p>Revised the default setting for the <code>contentLength</code> property of LSConnectionOptions,
   to allow the library to set it to the best value.</p>


<div class="version">2.1.0 build 40</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.1</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>

<p>Renamed the SDK from "SDK for OS X Clients (Unified API Version)" to follow the renaming
   of the operating system.<br/>
   References to "OS X" or "Mac OS X" now changed to "macOS".</p>

<p>Added new properties to LSConnectionOptions and new behavior to LSLightstreamerClient to limit
   the number of sessions that can be concurrently open to the same Server. New properties are:
   <code>maxConcurrentSessionsPerServer</code> (a class property) and
   <code>maxConcurrentSessionsPerServerExceededPolicy</code>. See docs for more information.</p>

<p>Added new event to LSClientDelegate to respond to an authentication challenge raised during
   network connection. New event is <code>client:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge:</code>.
   See docs for more information.</p>

<p>Fixed bug that caused a crash if an LSSubscription object was created before initializing
   an LSLightstreamerClient instance.</p>

<p>Removed any remaining use of NSURLConnection. Now all networking is done through NSURLSession.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that could have caused wrong error codes (that is, codes different from the documented ones)
   to be reported by subscription error events of LSSubscriptionDelegate.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of <code>subscription:didClearSnapshotForItemName:itemPos:</code> on
   LSSubscriptionDelegate, which is only predisposed.</p>

<p>The client library is now distributed as a framework.</p>

<p>Raised the minimum macOS version requirements to 10.9.</p>

<p>Fixed a memory leak that could become significant with intense update activity.</p>

<p>Fixed bug in network reachability thread that caused a 100% CPU usage if the client
   was initialized but left unconnected.</p>

<p>Clarified the documentation in regard to a few API methods that still have
   a partial implementation or are just predisposed and not implemented yet.</p>


<div class="version">2.0.0 build 28</div>

<p>Included in Lightstreamer distribution package. See "sdk_client_os_x_unified"
   (now sdk_client_macos_unified).</p>

<p>Added bitcode support.</p>

<p>Fixed casing of property "sessionID" of LSConnectionDetails as "sessionId",
for coherence with other Unified Client APIs.</p>

<p>Event <code>client:didChangeProperty:</code> now reports correct client
property names, e.g. "pollingTimeout" instead of "pollingMillis".</p>

<p>Fixed potential exception which could be thrown when setting or updating
fields and/or items list if logging is enabled at DEBUG level.
</p>

<p>Prevented reconnection attempts upon wrong answers from the Server.</p>

<p>Fixed an error in the log of the keepalive interval setting.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>
and <code>client:didChangeStatus:</code>, to specify that the former
is always preceded, not followed, by the latter with DISCONNECTED.</p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Made available as a prerelease on 17 Nov 2015</div></span>

<p>Changed the type and behavior of connectTimeout. This setting is now
represented as a String in order to accept the "auto" value. If "auto" is
specified the value used internally will be chosen (and possibly changed over
time) by the library itself. Note that "auto" is also the new default value.
To check and or modify the current value a property is exposed:
currentConnectTimeout.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: if the connectTimeout
property is changed by the client code, the given parameter must be modified
to be a String. If the connectTimeout property is accesses by the client code
its receiving variable must be converted to an NSString; moreover it is
likely that connectTimeout accesses should be replaced by
currentConnectTimeout ones.</span>
See the docs for further details.

<p>Introduced as an improved alternative to the SDK for OS X (now macOS) clients. The
   interface offered is completely different, and it is very similar to the
   one currently exposed by the SDK for JavaScript Clients.</p>

<div class="version">4.1.0 build 44</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 14 Mar 2019</div>

<p>Wholly revised the policy of reconnection attempts upon failed or unresponsive requests.
   Now the only property related with this policy is <code>retryDelay</code>, which now affects both
   (1) the minimum time to wait before trying a new connection to the Server in case the previous one failed
   for any reason and (2) the maximum time to wait for a response to a request before dropping the connection
   and trying with a different approach.<br/>
   Previously, point (2) was related with the <code>connectTimeout</code> and <code>currentConnectTimeout</code> properties.
   Now, in case of multiple failed attempts on unresponsive connections (i.e. while in CONNECTING state),
   the timeout used may still be increased dynamically and can be inspected through <code>currentConnectTimeout</code>,
   but this behavior is no longer configurable.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that tries to take control of the
   connection timeouts will no longer be obeyed, but we assume that the new policy will bring
   an overall improvement. Note that, when in CONNECTING state, the current timeout can be restored
   by issuing <code>disconnect</code>> and then <code>connect</code>.</span>
   As a result of the change, properties <code>connectTimeout</code> and <code>currentConnectTimeout</code>
   of <code>LSConnectionOptions</code> have been deprecated, as the setters have no effect and the getter
   is now equivalent to <code>retryDelay</code>.<br/>
   Also changed the default value of the <code>retryDelay</code> property from 2 seconds to 4 seconds.</p>

<p>Modified the implementation of <code>connect</code> when issued while the state is either
   DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY. The call will no longer interrupt
   the pending reconnection attempt, but it will be ignored, to lean on the current attempt.
   Note that a pending reconnection attempt can still be interrupted by issuing </code>disconnect</code> first.<br/>
   Modified in a similar way the implementation of <code>forcedTransport</code> property when issued
   while the state is either DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   the call will no longer interrupt the pending reconnection attempt, but it will apply
   to the outcome of that connection attempt.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug triggered by a call to <code>connect</code> or a change to <code>forcedTransport</code> issued while the client
   was attempting the recovery of the current session. This caused the recovery to fail,
   but, then, the library might not reissue the current subscriptions on the newly created session.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that could have caused session recovery to fail if preceded by a previous
   successful session recovery on the same session by more than a few seconds.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the <code>earlyWSOpenEnabled</code> property from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code>.
   This removes a potential incompatibility with cookie-based Load Balancers,
   at the expense of a possible slight delay in session startup.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the <code>slowingEnabled</code> property from <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code>.</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Incremented the minor version number.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running the Server with a license
   of "file" type which enables tvOS Client SDK up to version 4.0 or earlier, clients based

<p>Fixed a race condition that could lead the client to stop trying to reconnect
   to the server after a network disconnection or a server restart. This bug has
   been reported only when running on the Simulator, but could happen also on
   the device.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug causing a fatal error when the client recreated a session because
   of a network error and there were active MPN subscriptions.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug causing the client to ignore the <code>sessionRecoveryTimeout</code>
   when in state STALLED.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug causing the closing of the session when the user made a copy
   of a triggered <code>LSMPNSubscription</code> (with the copy constructor
   <code>initWithMPNSubscription:</code>) and then subscribed the copy.</p>

   multiple times.</p>


<div class="version">4.0.2 build 38</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 31 May 2018</div></span>

<p>Introduced a maximum time on attempts to recover the current session, after which
   a new session will be opened. The default is 15 seconds, but it can be customized
   with the newly added <code>sessionRecoveryTimeout</code> property in <code>LSConnectionOptions</code>.
   This fixes a potential case of permanently unsuccessful recovery, if the
   &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting were leveraged in a Server cluster and a Server
   instance happened to leave a cluster and were not automatically restarted.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism triggered
   by the use of the &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting on the Server,
   which could have caused feasible recovery attempts to fail.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the Stream-Sense mechanism, which was unable to recover to HTTP
   streaming in some specific cases of unavailability of a websocket connection.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug  affecting the interruption of a session on a WebSocket.
   In case of connectivity issues (or cluster affinity issues) the session might
   have remained open in the background, causing a resource waste.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, by which,
   a "sendMessage" request issued while a recovery operation was in place,
   could have never been notified to the listener until the end of the session
   (at which point an "abort" notification would have been issued to the listener),
   even in case the recovery was successful.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which, upon particular kinds of network issues and when the "early websocket open"
   feature was enabled, could have caused the client to abort session establishment or recovery
   attempts with no notification to the application.</p>

<p>Minor performance improvement in native HTTP connection mechanism by replacing threads with 
   GCD queues</p>


<div class="version">4.0.1 build 37</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 26 Feb 2018</div></span>

<p>Added the error code 21 in <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>,
   that can be received upon some failed requests, to inform that not only the current
   session was not found but it is also likely that the request was routed to the wrong
   Server instance. Previously, in the same cases, the SDK library would not invoke
   <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code> and would open a new session instead.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If using an existing application, you should
   check how it would handle the new (and unexpected) error code. A reconnection attempt would
   ensure the previous behavior, although this is no longer the suggested action.</span></p>

<p>Modified the default value of the <code>retryDelay</code> property from 5 to 2 seconds.
   This should help recovering from network outages of a few seconds, typical, for
   instance, of wifi/mobile network switches.</p>

<p>Extended the recovery mechanism to stalled sessions. Now, when the <code>reconnectTimeout</code>
   expires, an attempt to recover the current session will be performed first.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in version 3.0.0, which could have caused the property <code>snapshot</code>
   of <code>LSItemUpdate</code> to behave wrongly on subscriptions in which the snapshot
   was not requested.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced with version 3.0.0 preventing the connection when the Server
   configuration specifies a control-link address.</p>

<p>Fixed a rare race condition which could have caused the delay of subscription
   requests issued on a websocket session startup due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which, in a slow client scenario, could have caused the interruption
   of a polling session due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Fixed a race condition, mostly possible in an overloaded client scenario, which
   could have caused subscription or sendMessage requests to be delayed.</p>

<p>Fixed a harmless bug in the reverse heartbeat mechanism  which, upon session startup,
   could have caused an exception to be logged on the console.</p>

<p>Fixed the instructions provided in the documentation of <code>notificationFormat</code>
   property of the <code>LSMPNSubscription</code> class.</p>

<p>Extended the scope of error code 41 on the various MPN requests to all issues related
   with resource unavailability in the Server preventing the operation. Previously,
   such issues could have caused the whole session to be interrupted.</p>

<p>Added clarifications on licensing matters in the docs.</p>


<div class="version">4.0.0 build 34</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Dec 2017</div></span>

<p>Changed the internal folder from sdk_client_tvos_unified to sdk_client_tvos.</p>

<p>Introduced the support for Mobile Push Notifications. It consists in
   new methods in the <code>LSLightstreamerClient</code> class together with new dedicated
   classes. See the API documentation for details.<br/>
   An MPN subscription is backed by a real-time subscription, from which it may take
   any field value. Unlike the usual real-time subscriptions, MPN subscriptions are persistent:
   they survive the session and are identified by a permanent, global, unique key provided
   by the Server at time of activation.<br/>
   The notifications are managed by third-party services supported by the Server,
   which determine the notification characteristics and the supported devices.<br/>
   <span class="notInAPV">However, the support for Mobile Push Notifications
   by Lightstreamer Server (i.e. the MPN Module) is not available with this edition.</span></p>

<p>Added automatic recovery of sessions upon unexpected socket interruption during
   streaming or long polling. Now the library will perform an attempt to resume
   the session from the interruption point. The attempt may or may not succeed,
   also depending on the Server configuration of the recovery capability.<br/>
   As a consequence, introduced a new status, namely DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   to inform the application when a recovery attempt is being performed; hence,
   <code>client:didChangeStatus:</code> event and the <status>status</code> property can
   provide the new status.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that uses the status
   names received via <code>client:didChangeStatus:</code> or <status>status</code> may
   have to be aligned.</span></p>

<p>Extended the reverse heartbeat mechanism, governed by the <code>reverseHeartbeatInterval</code>
   property. Now, it will also allow the Server to detect when a client has abandoned
   a session although the socket remains open.<br/>
   Fixed the reverse heartbeat mechanism, which didn't work at all. Since version 3.0.0,
   setting a value for the <code>reverseHeartbeatInterval</code> property could have even
   caused the connection interruption.</p>

<p>Added the new Server error code 71 to <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>
   and clarified the difference with error code 60.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that, when under certain circumstances the server is unreachable,
   caused the client to enter in a tight reconnection loop ignoring the parameter <code>retryDelay</code>
   property of <code>LSConnectionOptions</code>.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in version 3, affecting the case of session establishment
   refusal by the Metadata Adapter (through a CreditsException) and the case of forced
   destroy (via external requests), when a negative custom error code was supplied.
   The subsequent invocation to <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>
   would carry code 61 (internal error) instead of the specified custom code.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which caused polling on WebSocket to fail. Note that this feature
   is available, but very rarely used.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of <code>serverSocketName</code> property, whose behavior has slightly
   changed since version 3.0.0.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of the <code>contentLength</code>, <code>keepaliveInterval</code>,
   and <code>reverseHeartbeatInterval</code> properties of <code>LSConnectionOptions</code>,
   to clarify that a zero value is not allowed in the first and it is allowed in the others.</p>

<p>Aligned the documentation to comply with current licensing policies.</p>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.1</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Made available as a prerelease on 19 Jul 2017</div></span>

<p>Introduced the use of WebSockets both for streaming and for subscription
   and client message requests, which brings an overall performance improvement.<br/>
   As a consequence, <code>forcedTransport</code> now also supports the "WS", "WS-STREAMING",
   and "WS-POLLING" values and the predisposed <code>earlyWSOpenEnabled</code> property
   is now effective.<br/>
   WebSocket support is provided by SocketRocket. Its license file is included in
   the distribution.</p>

<p>Added static methods <code>addCookies:forURL:</code> and <code>getCookiesForURL:</code>
   in LSLightstreamerClient, to allow for cookie sharing with the rest of the application
   when a local cookie store is being used.</p>

<p>Replaced the <code>maxBandwidth</code> property of LSConnectionOptions with two
   distinct properties: <code>requestedMaxBandwidth</code> and the read-only <code>realMaxBandwidth</code>,
   so that the setting is made with the former, while the value applied by
   the Server is only reported by the latter, now including changes during session
   life. The extension affects the property names and also the invocations
   of <code>client:didChangeProperty:</code> on the LSClientDelegate (see the docs for details).
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using <code>maxBandwidth</code>
   in any of the mentioned forms has to be ported and recompiled. If the property
   is not used in any form, existing compiled code can still run against the new
   library.</span></p>

<p>Introduced a new callback, <code>subscription:didReceiveRealFrequency:</code>,
   to the LSSubscriptionDelegate, to report the frequency constraint on the subscription as
   determined by the Server and their changes during subscription life. See the docs for details
   and special cases.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code has to be ported,
   by implementing the new method, and recompiled. Existing compiled code should
   still run against the new library: invocations to <code>subscription:didReceiveRealFrequency:</code>
   to the custom delegate would simply be ignored.</span></p>

<p>Introduced a new property, <code>clientIp</code>, in LSConnectionDetails;
   it is a read-only property with the keyword for <code>client:didChangeProperty:</code>
   (see the docs for details).</p>

<p>Completed the implementation of methods whose implementation was only partial.
   This regards:</p>
   <ul>
        <li><code>fieldSchema</code> in LSSubscription now also working for COMMAND mode subscriptions;</li>
        <li><code>slowingEnabled</code> in LSConnectionOptions now working if YES is supplied;</li>
        <li><code>subscription:didClearSnapshotForItemName:itemPos:</code> in the LSSubscriptionDelegate now invoked as expected.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Fixed the nullability annotations for the following methods and properties:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>LSClientDelegate:<ul>
       <li><code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code></li></ul>
   <li>LSClientMessageDelegate:<ul>
       <li><code>client:didDenyMessage:withCode:error:</code></li></ul>
   <li>LSLightstreamerClient:<ul>
       <li><code>setLoggerProvider:</code></li></ul>
   <li>LSSubscription:<ul>
       <li><code>commandSecondLevelFields</code></li>
       <li><code>commandSecondLevelFieldSchema</code></li>
       <li><code>fields</code></li>
       <li><code>fieldSchema</code></li>
       <li><code>itemGroup</code></li>
       <li><code>items</code></li></ul>
   </ul><p>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code written in Swift
   may no longer compile and should be aligned with the new signatures.
   No issues are expected for existing Objective-C code.</span></p>

<p>Revised the <code>sendMessage</code> implementation in the HTTP case, to limit recovery actions
   when messages are not to be ordered and a delegate is not provided.<br/>
   Revised <code>sendMessage</code> to accept 0 as a legal value for the <code>delayTimeout</code> argument;
   negative values will now be accepted to mean that the Server default timeout is to be used.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code using the 5-argument
   version of <code>sendMessage</code> and supplying 0 as <code>delayTimeout</code> must be modified to use
   -1 instead. Invocations to the 1-argument version don't have to be modified.</span></p>

<p>Fixed a bug which affected any unsubscription request issued so early
   that the corresponding subscription request had not been completed yet.
   Such unsubscription could have caused <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:</code> with code 19
   and the item would have been left subscribed to by the session on the Server,
   yet considered not subscribed to by the library.</p>

<p>Improved the efficiency by avoiding unnecessary encoding of characters in the
   requests (for instance, in group/schema names and in client messages).
   In particular, non-ascii characters are no longer encoded.</p>

<p>Improved the management of retries upon unsuccessful control requests.</p>

<p>Slightly delayed the availability of the <code>serverSocketName</code> property of
   LSConnectionDetails, which was already valued upon session start.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using
   <code>serverSocketName</code> right after a session start, should ensure that
   <code>client:didChangeProperty:</code> for <code>serverSocketName</code> gets invoked first.</span></p>

<p>Added the support for non standard unicode names, if supplied as hostnames
   in the Server's &lt;control_link_address&gt; configuration element.</p>

<p>Removed useless requests to the Server for bandwidth change when the Server
   is not configured for bandwidth management.</p>

<p>Improved the management of <code>HTTPExtraHeadersOnSessionCreationOnly</code>, when YES.
   Previously, the extra headers (supplied with <code>HTTPExtraHeaders</code>) were still
   sent, redundantly, on control requests.</p>

<p>Fully revised the documentation to be more readable from Xcode preview.<br/>
   Also switched to Appledoc for the generation of API docsets, for improved
   readability and conformance with other SDKs documentation.</p>

<p>Added new error codes 66 and 68 to <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>,
   <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:</code>, and
   <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:forCommandSecondLevelItemWithKey:</code>,
   to report server-side issues; previously, upon such problems, the connection was just interrupted.<br/>
   Added missing error code 60 to <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code> documentation;
   this error reports server-side licensing limitations.<br/>
   Removed error code 20 from <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:</code> and
   <code>subscription:didFailWithErrorCode:message:forCommandSecondLevelItemWithKey:</code>
   documentation; when a subscription request cannot find the session,
   the session is just closed and recovered immediately.<br/>
   Revised the documentation of the possible error codes.</p>

<p>Clarified in the documentation the meaning of nil in <code>requestedMaxFrequency</code>
   and <code>requestedBufferSize</code>. Extended <code>requestedMaxFrequency</code> to allow the setting
   also when the subscription is "active" and the current value is nil.</p>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 17 Jan 2017</div></span>

<p>Added the new setting <code>limitExceptionsUse</code> in LSLightstreamerClient to
   avoid throwing an exception when certain methods are called with an invalid parameter.
   E.g. <code>valueWithFieldName:</code> in LSItemUpdate and <code>valueWithItemName:fieldName:</code>
   in LSSubscription both obey to this new setting. See API docs for more information.</p>

<p>Removed a restriction on field names that can be supplied to a LSSubscription object
   within a "field list"; names made by numbers are now allowed.
   Obviously, the final validation on field names is made by the Metadata Adapter.</p>

<p>Moved the <code>LIB_NAME</code> and <code>LIB_VERSION</code> methods of LSLightstreamerClient to
   class properties. They can now be accessed with the dot notation. Previous class methods remain
   available.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the implementation of <code>disconnect</code>, whereby an ongoing loop
   of connection attempt was not interrupted in case of Server down or wrong address.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug, regarding only subscriptions in COMMAND mode,
   which caused unchanged fields to be redundantly indicated as changed.
   The bug didn't affect the returned data values.</p>

<p>Revised the default setting for the <code>contentLength</code> property of LSConnectionOptions,
   to allow the library to set it to the best value.</p>


<div class="version">2.1.0 build 19</div>

<p>Added new properties to LSConnectionOptions and new behavior to LSLightstreamerClient to limit
   the number of sessions that can be concurrently open to the same Server. New properties are:
   <code>maxConcurrentSessionsPerServer</code> (a class property) and
   <code>maxConcurrentSessionsPerServerExceededPolicy</code>. See docs for more information.</p>

<p>Added new event to LSClientDelegate to respond to an authentication challenge raised during
   network connection. New event is <code>client:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge:</code>.
   See docs for more information.</p>

<p>Fixed bug that caused a crash if an LSSubscription object was created before initializing
   an LSLightstreamerClient instance.</p>

<p>Removed any remaining use of NSURLConnection. Now all networking is done through NSURLSession.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that could have caused wrong error codes (that is, codes different from the documented ones)
   to be reported by subscription error events of LSSubscriptionDelegate.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of <code>subscription:didClearSnapshotForItemName:itemPos:</code> on
   LSSubscriptionDelegate, which is only predisposed.</p>

<p>The client library is now distributed as a framework.</p>

<p>Fixed the Server compatibility note for version 2.0.1 in this changelog,
   which was mistakenly brought back to 6.0.1.</p>

<p>Fixed a memory leak that could become significant with intense update activity.</p>

<p>Fixed bug in network reachability thread that caused a 100% CPU usage if the client
   was initialized but left unconnected.</p>

<p>Clarified the documentation in regard to a few API methods that still have
   a partial implementation or are just predisposed and not implemented yet.</p>

<p>Wholly revised the policy of reconnection attempts upon failed or unresponsive requests.
   Now the only property related with this policy is <code>retryDelay</code>, which now affects both
   (1) the minimum time to wait before trying a new connection to the Server in case the previous one failed

<p>Fixed a bug triggered by a call to <code>connect</code> or a change to <code>forcedTransport</code> issued while the client

<p>Fixed a race condition that could lead the client to stop trying to reconnect
   to the server after a network disconnection or a server restart. This bug has
   been reported only when running on the Simulator, but could happen also on

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 31 May 2018</div></span>

<p>Introduced a maximum time on attempts to recover the current session, after which
   a new session will be opened. The default is 15 seconds, but it can be customized
   with the newly added <code>sessionRecoveryTimeout</code> property in <code>LSConnectionOptions</code>.
   This fixes a potential case of permanently unsuccessful recovery, if the
   &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting were leveraged in a Server cluster and a Server
   instance happened to leave a cluster and were not automatically restarted.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism triggered
   by the use of the &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting on the Server,
   which could have caused feasible recovery attempts to fail.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, by which,
   a "sendMessage" request issued while a recovery operation was in place,
   could have never been notified to the listener until the end of the session
   (at which point an "abort" notification would have been issued to the listener),
   even in case the recovery was successful.</p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 26 Feb 2018</div></span>

<p>Added the error code 21 in <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code>,
   that can be received upon some failed requests, to inform that not only the current
   session was not found but it is also likely that the request was routed to the wrong
   Server instance. Previously, in the same cases, the SDK library would not invoke
   <code>client:didReceiveServerError:withMessage:</code> and would open a new session instead.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If using an existing application, you should
   check how it would handle the new (and unexpected) error code. A reconnection attempt would
   ensure the previous behavior, although this is no longer the suggested action.</span></p>

<p>Modified the default value of the <code>retryDelay</code> property from 5 to 2 seconds.
   This should help recovering from network outages of a few seconds, typical, for
   instance, of wifi/mobile network switches.</p>

<p>Extended the recovery mechanism to stalled sessions. Now, when the <code>reconnectTimeout</code>
   expires, an attempt to recover the current session will be performed first.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which could have caused the property <code>snapshot</code> of
   <code>LSItemUpdate</code> to behave wrongly on subscriptions in which the snapshot
   was not requested.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug preventing the connection when the Server configuration specifies a
   control-link address.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which, in a slow client scenario, could have caused the interruption
   of a polling session due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Fixed a race condition, mostly possible in an overloaded client scenario, which
   could have caused subscription or sendMessage requests to be delayed.</p>

<p>Fixed a harmless bug in the reverse heartbeat mechanism  which, upon session startup,
   could have caused an exception to be logged on the console.</p>

<p>Fixed the instructions provided in the documentation of <code>notificationFormat</code>
   property of the <code>LSMPNSubscription</code> class.</p>

<p>Extended the scope of error code 41 on the various MPN requests to all issues related
   with resource unavailability in the Server preventing the operation. Previously,
   such issues could have caused the whole session to be interrupted.</p>

<p>Added clarifications on licensing matters in the docs.</p>

<p>Wholly revised the policy of reconnection attempts upon failed or unresponsive requests.
   Now the only property related with this policy is "RetryDelay", which now affects both
   (1) the minimum time to wait before trying a new connection to the Server in case the previous one failed 
   for any reason and (2) the maximum time to wait for a response to a request before dropping the connection 
   and trying with a different approach.<br/>
   Previously, point (2) was related with the "ConnectTimeout" and "CurrentConnectTimeout" properties.
   Now, in case of multiple failed attempts on unresponsive connections (i.e. while in CONNECTING state),
   the timeout used may still be increased dynamically and can be inspected through getCurrentConnectTimeout,
   but this behavior is no longer configurable.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that tries to take control of the

   As a result of the change, methods setConnectTimeout, getConnectTimeout and setCurrentConnectTimeout 
   of ConnectionOptions have been deprecated, as the setters have no effect and the getter
   is now equivalent to getRetryDelay.<br/>
   Also changed the default value of the "RetryDelay" property from 2 seconds to 4 seconds.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the "EarlyWSOpenEnabled" property from true to false

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in version 4.0.0, affecting the interruption of a session
   on a WebSocket (available in the "full" version of the library).
   In case of connectivity issues (or cluster affinity issues) the session might
   have remained open in the background, causing a resource waste.</p>

<p>Modified the constructor of the MpnDevice class, by removing the "senderId" argument,
   which was not actually used. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
   Existing code leveraging the MPN support and using this constructor (instead
   of the available factory method) needs to be aligned and recompiled.</span></p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Dec 2017</div></span>

<p>Changed the internal folder from sdk_client_android_unified to sdk_client_android.</p>

<p>Introduced the support for Mobile Push Notifications. It consists in
   new methods in the LightstreamerClient class together with new dedicated
   classes under the "mpn" subpackage. See the API documentation for details.<br/>
   As a consequence, new dependencies from third-party libraries have been added.<br/>
   An MPN subscription is backed by a real-time subscription, from which it may take
   any field value. Unlike the usual real-time subscriptions, MPN subscriptions are persistent:
   they survive the session and are identified by a permanent, global, unique key provided
   by the Server at time of activation.<br/>
   The notifications are managed by third-party services supported by the Server,
   which determine the notification characteristics and the supported devices.<br/>
   <span class="notInAPV">However, the support for Mobile Push Notifications
   by Lightstreamer Server (i.e. the MPN Module) is not available with this edition.</span></p>
   
<p>Restricted the compatibility constraint to Android 4 or later.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing applications can keep
   running on earlier Android versions as long they don't leverage the MPN support.</span></p>

<p>Added automatic recovery of sessions upon unexpected socket interruption during
   streaming or long polling. Now the library will perform an attempt to resume
   the session from the interruption point. The attempt may or may not succeed,
   also depending on the Server configuration of the recovery capability.<br/>
   As a consequence, introduced a new status, namely DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   to inform the application when a recovery attempt is being performed; hence,
   onStatusChange and getStatus can provide the new status.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that uses the status
   names received via onStatusChange or getStatus may have to be aligned.</span></p>

<p>Extended the reverse heartbeat mechanism, governed by the "ReverseHeartbeatInterval"
   property. Now, it will also allow the Server to detect when a client has abandoned
   a session although the socket remains open.<br/>
   Fixed the reverse heartbeat mechanism, which didn't work at all. Since version 3.0.0,
   setting a value for the "ReverseHeartbeatInterval" property could have even caused
   the connection interruption.</p>

<p>Addressed an issue in the "compact" version of the library, which, in particular
   circumstances (more likely to occur in long polling), could have caused the silent
   loss of events on the session. Look for "sun.net.http.retryPost" in the Javadoc
   overview for details.</p>

<p>Added the new Server error code 71 to onServerError and clarified the difference
   with error code 60.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of getServerSocketName, whose behavior has slightly
   changed since version 3.0.0.</p>
   
<p>Fixed the documentation of the "ContentLength", "KeepaliveInterval", and
   "ReverseHeartbeatInterval" properties of ConnectionOptions, to clarify that
   a zero value is not allowed in the first and it is allowed in the others.</p>

<p>Fixed the javadocs, by removing some class member variables that were not
   supposed to be documented.</p>

<p>Aligned the documentation to comply with current licensing policies.</p>

<div class="version">3.1.1 build 100</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.1.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 29 May 2017</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in the previous release, as unnecessary encoding
   of characters in the requests was saved. The bug caused any '+' characters
   in the requests (for instance, in group/schema names and in client messages)
   to be handled incorrectly.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which caused polling on WebSocket to fail. Note that this feature
   is available, but very rarely used.</p>


<div class="version">3.1.0 build 99</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.1.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 25 May 2017</div></span>

<p>Fixed the support for proxies, which could have caused connections to fail in case 
   a public DNS were not available from the client host.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which affected any unsubscription request issued so early
   that the corresponding subscription request had not been completed yet.
   Such unsubscription could have caused onSubscriptionError with code 19
   and the item would have been left subscribed to by the session on the Server,
   yet considered not subscribed to by the library.</p>

<p>Revised the support for cookies:
   </p><ul>
       <li>Fixed cookie handling in the "compact" version of the library, whereby
           some cookie settings received from Lightstreamer Server could have been
           ignored due to a case sensitive test of the "Set-Cookie" header name.</li>
       <li>Fixed a missing case in cookie handling, concerning the propagation
           of cookies received from Lightstreamer Server upon a WebSocket handshake.
           Note that the case in which new cookies are received in this way
           is unlikely to occur.
           This issue did not affect the "compact" version of the library.</li>
       <li>Regarding cookies received from the Server upon normal HTTP requests,
           fixed the handling of the case in which multiple cookie settings
           are received, as only one of them was considered and the other ones
           were ignored.
           This issue did not affect the "compact" version of the library.</li>
       <li>Enforced cookie handling regardless that a default java.net.CookieHandler
           has been set. If not set at the beginning, a local cookie store will
           be setup. Note that, in this case, cookies will not be automatically
           shared with other connections performed by the application.</li>
       <li>Clarified in the docs that, in the "full" (i.e. non "compact") version
           of the library, the default java.net.CookieHandler is supported only
           if it is of type java.net.CookieManager.</li>
       <li>Added static methods addCookies and getCookies in LightstreamerClient,
           to allow for cookie sharing with the rest of the application when a local
           cookie store is being used.</li>
       <li>Removed the support for the "Set-Cookie2" HTTP header, whose specification
           has been deprecated and the use discontinued.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Improved the efficiency by avoiding unnecessary encoding of characters in the
   requests (for instance, in group/schema names and in client messages).
   In particular, non-ascii characters are no longer encoded.</p>

<p>Introduced a configuration property to choose whether multiple instances
   of LightstreamerClient should use dedicated threads for their internal operations
   instead of sharing a single one. See the Javadoc comment for the LightstreamerClient
   class for details.</p>

<p>Fixed spurious entries in the Javadoc of the Subscription class.</p>


<div class="version">3.0.1 build 98</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.1.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 2 Feb 2017</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug in TLS management for the newly introduced support of WebSockets,
   whereby, when the EarlyWSOpenEnabled property was true, the WebSocket
   connections was open without performing the TLS certificate check.
   However, in case of an untrusted certificate, still no request could
   be sent to the Server and no session could be opened. Obviously, the bug
   did not affect the "compact" version of the library.</p>

<p>Improved the management of retries upon unsuccessful control requests.</p>


<div class="version">3.0.0 build 97</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.1.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Jan 2017</div></span>

<p>Introduced the use of WebSockets both for streaming and for subscription
   and client message requests, which brings an overall performance improvement.<br/>
   As a consequence, setForcedTransport now also supports the "WS", "WS-STREAMING",
   and "WS-POLLING" values and the predisposed setEarlyWSOpenEnabled method
   is now effective.</p>

<p>Modified the name of the library made available via Maven. Now, ls-android-client
   should be referred in place of ls-android-client-compact. However, the latter
   is still available as an alternative "compact" version of the library. In fact,
   the memory footprint of the library, when including its dependencies, has
   increased significantly, whereas the "compact" version has not grown, but it
   does not include WebSocket support.</p>

<p>Replaced the "maxBandwidth" property of the ConnectionOptions bean with two
   distinct properties: "requestedMaxBandwidth" and the read-only "realMaxBandwidth",
   so that the setting is made with the former, while the value applied by
   the Server is only reported by the latter, now including changes during session
   life. The extension affects the getter and setter names and also the invocations
   of onPropertyChange on the ClientListener (see the docs for details).
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using "maxBandwidth"
   in any of the mentioned forms has to be ported and recompiled. If the property
   is not used in any form, existing compiled code can still run against the new
   library.</span></p>

<p>Introduced a new callback, "onRealMaxFrequency", to the SubscriptionListener,
   to report the frequency constraint on the subscription as determined by the
   Server and their changes during subscription life. See the docs for details
   and special cases.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code has to be ported,
   by implementing the new method, and recompiled. Existing compiled code should
   still run against the new library: invocations to onRealMaxFrequency to the
   custom listener would cause an exception that would be caught internally.</span></p>

<p>Introduced a new property, "clientIp", in the ConnectionDetails bean;
   it is a read-only property with the related getter and keyword for
   onPropertyChange (see the docs for details).</p>

<p>Completed the implementation of methods whose implementation was only partial.
   This regards:</p>
   <ul>
        <li>setFieldSchema in Subscription now also working for COMMAND mode subscriptions;</li>
        <li>setSlowingEnabled in ConnectionOptions now working if true is supplied;</li>
        <li>onClearSnapshot in the SubscriptionListener now invoked as expected.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Removed a restriction on field names that can be supplied to a Subscription object
   within a "field list"; names made by numbers are now allowed.
   Obviously, the final validation on field names is made by the Metadata Adapter.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the implementation of disconnect(), whereby an ongoing loop
of connection attempt was not interrupted in case of Server down or wrong address.</p>

<p>Revised the sendMessage implementation in the HTTP case, to limit recovery actions
   when messages are not to be ordered and a listener is not provided.<br/>
   Revised sendMessage to accept 0 as a legal value for the "delayTimeout" argument;
   negative values will now be accepted to mean that the Server default timeout is to be used.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code using the 5-argument
   version of sendMessage and supplying 0 as "delayTimeout" must be modified to use
   -1 instead. Invocations to the 1-argument version don't have to be modified.</span></p>

<p>Added new error codes 66 and 68 to onServerError, onSubscriptionError, and
   onSecondLevelSubscriptionError, to report server-side issues; previously,
   upon such problems, the connection was just interrupted.<br/>
   Added missing error code 60 to onServerError documentation; this error
   reports server-side licensing limitations.<br/>
   Removed error code 20 from onSubscriptionError and onSecondLevelSubscriptionError
   documentation; when a subscription request cannot find the session,
   the session is just closed and recovered immediately.<br/>
   Revised the documentation of the possible error codes.</p>

<p>Slightly delayed the availability of the "serverSocketName" property of the
   ConnectionDetails bean, which was already valued upon session start.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using
   getServerSocketName right after a session start, should ensure that
   onPropertyChange for "serverSocketName" gets invoked first.</span></p>

<p>Added the support for non standard unicode names, if supplied as hostnames
   in the Server's &lt;control_link_address&gt; configuration element.</p>

<p>Removed useless requests to the Server for bandwidth change when the Server
   is not configured for bandwidth management.</p>

<p>Improved the management of setHttpExtraHeadersOnSessionCreationOnly, when true.
   Previously, the extra headers (supplied with setHttpExtraHeaders) were still
   sent, redundantly, on control requests.</p>

<p>Revised the default setting for the "ContentLength" property of ConnectionOptions,
   to allow the library to set it to the best value.</p>

<p>Clarified in the documentation the meaning of null in setRequestedMaxFrequency
   and setRequestedBufferSize. Extended setRequestedMaxFrequency to allow the setting
   also when the subscription is "active" and the current value is null.</p>

<p>Improved the documentation of various methods in regard to the special case
   of two-level subscriptions.<br/> Detailed the documentation of the various
   property getters and setters in regard to the possible values.</p>

<p>Improved the Javadocs, by shortening the concise descriptions of some classes
   and methods.</p>


<div class="version">2.0.4 build 94.1</div>

The bug didn't affect the returned data values.</p>


<div class="version">2.0.3 build 94</div>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 14 Nov 2016</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug which could have caused onSubscriptionError and
   onCommandSecondLevelSubscriptionError to report wrong error codes,
   that is, codes different from the documented ones.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of onClearSnapshot, which is only predisposed.</p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 22 Jul 2016</div></span>

<p>Clarified the documentation in regard to a few API methods that still have
   a partial implementation or are just predisposed and not implemented yet.</p>


<div class="version">2.0.0 build 87</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.1.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 10 May 2016</div></span>

<p>As moved to final, renamed the internal folder from "sdk_client_android_alpha"
   to "sdk_client_android_unified".</p>

<p>Changed the names of some properties in the ConnectionOptions bean. To resume:
   </p><ul>
       <li>keepaliveMillis has become keepaliveInterval</li>
       <li>idleMillis has become idleTimeout</li>
       <li>pollingMillis has become pollingInterval</li>
       <li>reverseHeartbeatMillis has become reverseHeartbeatInterval</li>
   </ul><p>
   This affects the getter and setter names and also the invocations of
   onPropertyChange on the ClientListener. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
   Custom code using any of the mentioned properties has to be ported and any
   related binaries have to be recompiled.</span></p>

<p>Fixed potential NullPointerException which could be thrown when setting or updating
fields and/or items list if logging is enabled at DEBUG level.
</p>

<p>Changed the type and behavior of the getConnectTimeout/setConnectTimeout. This setting is now
represented as a String in order to accept the "auto" value. If "auto" is specified the value used
internally will be chosen (and possibly changed overtime) by the library itself. Note that "auto" is
also the new default value.
<p>To check and or modify the current value, a new CurrentConnectTimeout property,
with its getter/setter pair in ConnectionOptions, is exposed.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: if the setConnectTimeout method is called
by the client code, the given parameter must be modified to be a String. If the getConnectTimeout
method is called by the client code its receiving variable must be converted to a String; moreover
it is likely that getConnectTimeout calls should be replaced by getCurrentConnectTimeout ones.</span>
See the docs for further details.
</p>

<p>Prevented reconnection attempts upon wrong answers from the Server.</p>

<p>Fixed an error in the log of the keepalive interval setting.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of onServerError and onStatusChange, to specify that onServerError
is always preceded, not followed, by onStatusChange with DISCONNECTED.</p>

<p>Revised javadoc formatting style and fixed various typos in the javadocs.</p>

   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using the LoggerProvider
   interface should be revised, based on the new documentation; see setLoggerProvider.</span></p>

<p>Improved the handling of long polling.</p>

<p>Wholly revised the policy of reconnection attempts upon failed or unresponsive requests.
   Now the only property related with this policy is "RetryDelay", which now affects both
   (1) the minimum time to wait before trying a new connection to the Server in case the previous one failed 
   for any reason and (2) the maximum time to wait for a response to a request before dropping the connection 
   and trying with a different approach.<br/>
   Previously, point (2) was related with the "ConnectTimeout" and "CurrentConnectTimeout" properties.
   Now, in case of multiple failed attempts on unresponsive connections (i.e. while in CONNECTING state),
   the timeout used may still be increased dynamically and can be inspected through getCurrentConnectTimeout,
   but this behavior is no longer configurable.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that tries to take control of the
   connection timeouts will no longer be obeyed, but we assume that the new policy will bring
   an overall improvement. Note that, when in CONNECTING state, the current timeout can be restored
   by issuing disconnect() and then connect().</span>
   As a result of the change, methods setConnectTimeout, getConnectTimeout and setCurrentConnectTimeout 
   of ConnectionOptions have been deprecated, as the setters have no effect and the getter
   is now equivalent to getRetryDelay.<br/>
   Also changed the default value of the "RetryDelay" property from 2 seconds to 4 seconds.</p>

<p>Modified the implementation of connect() when issued while the state is either
   DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY. The call will no longer interrupt
   the pending reconnection attempt, but it will be ignored, to lean on the current attempt.
   Note that a pending reconnection attempt can still be interrupted by issuing disconnect() first.<br/>
   Modified in a similar way the implementation of setForcedTransport(); when issued
   while the state is either DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   the call will no longer interrupt the pending reconnection attempt, but it will apply
   to the outcome of that connection attempt.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug triggered by a call to connect() or setForcedTransport() issued while the client
   was attempting the recovery of the current session. This caused the recovery to fail,
   but, then, the library might not reissue the current subscriptions on the newly created session.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug that could have caused session recovery to fail if preceded by a previous
   successful session recovery on the same session by more than a few seconds.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the "EarlyWSOpenEnabled" property from true to false 
   (see ConnectionOptions.setEarlyWSOpenEnabled). This removes a potential incompatibility
   with cookie-based Load Balancers, at the expense of a possible slight delay in session startup.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the "SlowingEnabled" property from true to false 
   (see ConnectionOptions.setSlowingEnabled).</p>

<p class="notInAMS">Incremented the minor version number.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running the Server with a license

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 19 Nov 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed a very rare race condition that could lead the client to stop trying to reconnect
   to the server after a network disconnection or a server restart.</p>

<p>Enforced https links in instructions for maven download, as with http it might fail.</p>


<div class="version">4.2.7 build 1323</div>

<div class="version">4.2.6 build 1318</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 28 May 2018</div></span>

<p>Introduced a maximum time on attempts to recover the current session, after which
   a new session will be opened. The default is 15 seconds, but it can be customized
   with the newly added "SessionRecoveryTimeout" property in ConnectionOptions.
   This fixes a potential case of permanently unsuccessful recovery, if the
   &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting were leveraged in a Server cluster and a Server
   instance happened to leave a cluster and were not automatically restarted.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism triggered
   by the use of the &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting on the Server,
   which could have caused feasible recovery attempts to fail.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the Stream-Sense mechanism, which was unable to recover to HTTP
   streaming in some specific cases of unavailability of a websocket connection.</p>

<p>Updated the included version of the third-party Netty library.</p>


<div class="version">4.2.5 build 1314</div>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 13 Apr 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in version 4.2.0, affecting the interruption of a session
   on a WebSocket. In case of connectivity issues (or cluster affinity issues) the
   session might have remained open in the background, causing a resource waste.</p>


<div class="version">4.2.4 build 1313</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 9 Apr 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, by which,
   a sendMessage request issued while a recovery operation was in place,
   could have never been notified to the listener until the end of the session
   (at which point an "abort" notification would have been issued to the listener),
   even in case the recovery was successful.</p>

<p>Improved internal debug log.</p>


<div class="version">4.2.3 build 1312</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 26 Mar 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug which, upon particular kinds of network issues and when the "early websocket open"
   feature was enabled, could have caused the client to abort session establishment or recovery
   attempts with no notification to the application.</p>


<div class="version">4.2.2 build 1311</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 27 Feb 2018</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in version 4.0, which could have caused the method
   ItemUpdate.isSnapshot to behave wrongly on subscriptions in which the snapshot
   was not requested.</p>


<div class="version">4.2.1 build 1309</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 21 Feb 2018</div></span>

<p>Added the error code 21 in onServerError, that can be received upon some failed
   requests, to inform that not only the current session was not found but it is also likely
   that the request was routed to the wrong Server instance. Previously, in the same cases,
   the SDK library would not invoke onServerError and would open a new session instead.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If using an existing application, you should
   check how it would handle the new (and unexpected) error code. A reconnection attempt would
   ensure the previous behavior, although this is no longer the suggested action.</span></p>

<p>Modified the default value of the "RetryDelay" property from 5000 to 2000 ms.
   This should help recovering from network outages of a few seconds.</p>

<p>Extended the recovery mechanism to stalled sessions. Now, when the ReconnectTimeout
   expires, an attempt to recover the current session will be performed first.</p>
   
<p>Fixed a bug introduced with version 3.0.0 preventing the connection when the server
   configuration specifies a control-link address.</p>

<p>Fixed a rare race condition which could have caused the delay of subscription
   requests issued on a websocket session startup due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which, in a slow client scenario, could have caused the interruption
   of a polling session due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Fixed a race condition, mostly possible in an overloaded client scenario, which
   could have caused subscription or sendMessage requests to be delayed.</p>

<p>Fixed a harmless bug on the implementation of disconnectFuture(), which, in rare cases,
   could have caused a NullPointerException to be logged on the console.</p>

<p>Fixed a harmless bug in the reverse heartbeat mechanism  which, upon session startup,
   could have caused a NullPointerException to be logged on the console.</p>

<p>Added clarifications on licensing matters in the docs.</p>


<div class="version">4.2.0 build 1306</div>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Dec 2017</div></span>

<p>Changed the internal folder from sdk_client_java_se_unified to sdk_client_java_se.</p>

<p>Added automatic recovery of sessions upon unexpected socket interruption during
   streaming or long polling. Now the library will perform an attempt to resume
   the session from the interruption point. The attempt may or may not succeed,
   also depending on the Server configuration of the recovery capability.<br/>
   As a consequence, introduced a new status, namely DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   to inform the application when a recovery attempt is being performed; hence,
   onStatusChange and getStatus can provide the new status.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that uses the status
   names received via onStatusChange or getStatus may have to be aligned.</span></p>

<p>Extended the reverse heartbeat mechanism, governed by the "ReverseHeartbeatInterval"
   property. Now, it will also allow the Server to detect when a client has abandoned
   a session although the socket remains open.<br/>
   Fixed the reverse heartbeat mechanism, which didn't work at all. Since version 4.0.0,
   setting a value for the "ReverseHeartbeatInterval" property could have even caused
   the connection interruption.</p>

<p>Added a new dependency from a third-party library.</p>

<p>Added the new Server error code 71 to onServerError and clarified the difference
   with error code 60.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of getServerSocketName, whose behavior has slightly
   changed since version 4.0.0.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of the "ContentLength", "KeepaliveInterval", and
   "ReverseHeartbeatInterval" properties of ConnectionOptions, to clarify that
   a zero value is not allowed in the first and it is allowed in the others.</p>

<p>Fixed the javadocs, by removing some class member variables that were not
   supposed to be documented.</p>

<p>Aligned the documentation to comply with current licensing policies.</p>


<div class="version">4.1.7 build 1290.10</div>

<p>Fixed a bug, introduced in version 4, affecting the case of session establishment
   refusal by the Metadata Adapter (through a CreditsException) and the case of forced
   destroy (via external requests), when a negative custom error code was supplied.
   The subsequent invocation to onServerError would carry code 61 (internal error)
   instead of the specified custom code.</p>


<div class="version">4.1.3 build 1290.1</div>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 6 Jul 2017</div></span>

<p>Fixed the reconnection algorithm, which could have caused a tight reconnection loop
in particular conditions when the server is not available.</p>

<p>Added the null annotations (according to JSR 305) in the class files of public
   classes, to better support library use with Kotlin and any other language which
   leverages JSR 305.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code written in Kotlin

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 29 May 2017</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in the previous release, as unnecessary encoding
   of characters in the requests was saved. The bug caused any '+' characters
   in the requests (for instance, in group/schema names and in client messages)
   to be handled incorrectly.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which caused polling on WebSocket to fail. Note that this feature
   is available, but very rarely used.</p>


<div class="version">4.1.0 build 1288</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.1.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 25 May 2017</div></span>

<p>Fixed the support for proxies, which could have caused connections to fail in case 
   a public DNS were not available from the client host.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which affected any unsubscription request issued so early
   that the corresponding subscription request had not been completed yet.
   Such unsubscription could have caused onSubscriptionError with code 19
   and the item would have been left subscribed to by the session on the Server,
   yet considered not subscribed to by the library.</p>

<p>Revised the support for cookies:
   </p><ul>
       <li>Fixed a missing case in cookie handling, concerning the propagation
           of cookies received from Lightstreamer Server upon a WebSocket handshake.
           Note that the case in which new cookies are received in this way
           is unlikely to occur.</li>
       <li>Regarding cookies received from the Server upon normal HTTP requests,
           fixed the handling of the case in which multiple cookie settings
           are received, as only one of them was considered and the other ones
           were ignored.</li>
       <li>Enforced cookie handling regardless that a default java.net.CookieHandler
           has been set. If not set at the beginning, a local cookie store will
           be setup. Note that, in this case, cookies will not be automatically
           shared with other connections performed by the application.</li>
       <li>Clarified in the docs that the default java.net.CookieHandler
           is supported only if it is of type java.net.CookieManager.</li>
       <li>Added static methods addCookies and getCookies in LightstreamerClient,
           to allow for cookie sharing with the rest of the application when a local
           cookie store is being used.</li>
       <li>Removed the support for the "Set-Cookie2" HTTP header, whose specification
           has been deprecated and the use discontinued.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Improved the efficiency by avoiding unnecessary encoding of characters in the
   request (for instance, in group/schema names and in client messages).
   In particular, non-ascii characters are no longer encoded.</p>

<p>Introduced a configuration property to choose whether multiple instances
   of LightstreamerClient should use dedicated threads for their internal operations
   instead of sharing a single one. See the Javadoc comment for the LightstreamerClient
   class for details.</p>

<p>Fixed spurious entries in the Javadoc of the Subscription class.</p>


<div class="version">4.0.1 build 1283</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.1.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 2 Feb 2017</div></span>

<p>Fixed a bug in TLS management for the newly introduced support of WebSockets,
   whereby, when the EarlyWSOpenEnabled property was true, the WebSocket
   connections was open without performing the TLS certificate check.
   However, in case of an untrusted certificate, still no request could
   be sent to the Server and no session could be opened.</p>

<p>Improved the management of retries upon unsuccessful control requests.</p>


<div class="version">4.0.0 build 1282</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.1.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 20 Jan 2017</div></span>

<p>Introduced the use of WebSockets both for streaming and for subscription
   and client message requests, which brings an overall performance improvement.<br/>
   As a consequence, setForcedTransport now also supports the "WS", "WS-STREAMING",
   and "WS-POLLING" values and the predisposed setEarlyWSOpenEnabled method
   is now effective.</p>

<p>Replaced the "maxBandwidth" property of the ConnectionOptions bean with two
   distinct properties: "requestedMaxBandwidth" and the read-only "realMaxBandwidth",
   so that the setting is made with the former, while the value applied by
   the Server is only reported by the latter, now including changes during session
   life. The extension affects the getter and setter names and also the invocations
   of onPropertyChange on the ClientListener (see the docs for details).
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using "maxBandwidth"
   in any of the mentioned forms has to be ported and recompiled. If the property
   is not used in any form, existing compiled code can still run against the new
   library.</span></p>

<p>Introduced a new callback, "onRealMaxFrequency", to the SubscriptionListener,
   to report the frequency constraint on the subscription as determined by the
   Server and their changes during subscription life. See the docs for details
   and special cases.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code has to be ported,
   by implementing the new method, and recompiled. Existing compiled code should
   still run against the new library: invocations to onRealMaxFrequency to the
   custom listener would cause an exception that would be caught internally.</span></p>

<p>Introduced a new property, "clientIp", in the ConnectionDetails bean;
   it is a read-only property with the related getter and keyword for
   onPropertyChange (see the docs for details).</p>

<p>Completed the implementation of methods whose implementation was only partial.
   This regards:</p>
   <ul>
        <li>setFieldSchema in Subscription now also working for COMMAND mode subscriptions;</li>
        <li>setSlowingEnabled in ConnectionOptions now working if true is supplied;</li>
        <li>onClearSnapshot in the SubscriptionListener now invoked as expected.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Removed a restriction on field names that can be supplied to a Subscription object
   within a "field list"; names made by numbers are now allowed.
   Obviously, the final validation on field names is made by the Metadata Adapter.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug which could have caused unexpected short blocks in the case of 
synchronous polling mode</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the implementation of disconnect(), whereby an ongoing loop
of connection attempt was not interrupted in case of Server down or wrong address.</p>

<p>Revised the sendMessage implementation in the HTTP case, to limit recovery actions
   when messages are not to be ordered and a listener is not provided.<br/>
   Revised sendMessage to accept 0 as a legal value for the "delayTimeout" argument;
   negative values will now be accepted to mean that the Server default timeout is to be used.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code using the 5-argument
   version of sendMessage and supplying 0 as "delayTimeout" must be modified to use
   -1 instead. Invocations to the 1-argument version don't have to be modified.</span></p>

<p>Added new error codes 66 and 68 to onServerError, onSubscriptionError, and
   onSecondLevelSubscriptionError, to report server-side issues; previously,
   upon such problems, the connection was just interrupted.<br/>
   Added missing error code 60 to onServerError documentation; this error
   reports server-side licensing limitations.<br/>
   Removed error code 20 from onSubscriptionError and onSecondLevelSubscriptionError
   documentation; when a subscription request cannot find the session,
   the session is just closed and recovered immediately.<br/>
   Revised the documentation of the possible error codes.</p>

<p>Slightly delayed the availability of the "serverSocketName" property of the
   ConnectionDetails bean, which was already valued upon session start.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using
   getServerSocketName right after a session start, should ensure that
   onPropertyChange for "serverSocketName" gets invoked first.</span></p>

<p>Added the support for non standard unicode names, if supplied as hostnames
   in the Server's &lt;control_link_address&gt; configuration element.</p>

<p>Removed useless requests to the Server for bandwidth change when the Server
   is not configured for bandwidth management.</p>

<p>Improved the management of setHttpExtraHeadersOnSessionCreationOnly, when true.
   Previously, the extra headers (supplied with setHttpExtraHeaders) were still
   sent, redundantly, on control requests.</p>

<p>Revised the default setting for the "ContentLength" property of ConnectionOptions,
   to allow the library to set it to the best value.</p>

<p>Clarified in the documentation the meaning of null in setRequestedMaxFrequency
   and setRequestedBufferSize. Extended setRequestedMaxFrequency to allow the setting
   also when the subscription is "active" and the current value is null.</p>

<p>Improved the documentation of various methods in regard to the special case
   of two-level subscriptions.<br/> Detailed the documentation of the various
   property getters and setters in regard to the possible values.</p>

<p>Improved the Javadocs, by shortening the concise descriptions of some classes
   and methods.</p>

<p>As moved to final, renamed the internal folder from "sdk_client_java_se_beta"
   to "sdk_client_java_se_unified".</p>

<p>Changed the names of some properties in the ConnectionOptions bean. To resume:
   </p><ul>
       <li>keepaliveMillis has become keepaliveInterval</li>
       <li>idleMillis has become idleTimeout</li>
       <li>pollingMillis has become pollingInterval</li>
       <li>reverseHeartbeatMillis has become reverseHeartbeatInterval</li>
   </ul><p>
   This affects the getter and setter names and also the invocations of
   onPropertyChange on the ClientListener. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
   Custom code using any of the mentioned properties has to be ported and any
   related binaries have to be recompiled.</span></p>

<p>Added logging messages (at ERROR level) for those cases in which runtime exceptions could be thrown
while running some asynchronus code paths.
</p>

<p>Fixed potential NullPointerException which could be thrown when setting or updating
fields and/or items list if logging is enabled at DEBUG level.
</p>

<p>Fixed an error in the log of the keepalive interval setting.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of onServerError and onStatusChange, to specify that onServerError
is always preceded, not followed, by onStatusChange with DISCONNECTED.</p>

<p>Revised javadoc formatting style and fixed various typos in the javadocs.</p>

<p>Updated the versions of some external libraries which the SDK depends upon.</p>


<div class="version">3.0 build 1265.1</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.1</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>

<p>Changed the type and behavior of the getConnectTimeout/setConnectTimeout. This setting is now
represented as a String in order to accept the "auto" value. If "auto" is specified the value used
internally will be chosen (and possibly changed overtime) by the library itself. Note that "auto" is
also the new default value.
<p>To check and or modify the current value, a new CurrentConnectTimeout property,
with its getter/setter pair in ConnectionOptions, is exposed.
<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: if the setConnectTimeout method is called
by the client code, the given parameter must be modified to be a String. If the getConnectTimeout
method is called by the client code its receiving variable must be converted to a String; moreover
it is likely that getConnectTimeout calls should be replaced by getCurrentConnectTimeout ones.</span>
See the docs for further details.
</p>

<p>Added the new method disconnectFuture to the LigtstreamerClient class, with the purpose to provide a notification when all
threads started by all LightstreamerClient instances living in the JVM have been terminated, because no more activities need to be managed
and hence event dispatching is no longer necessary.<br/>
Such method is especially useful in those environments which require an appropriate resource management, like "full" Java EE application servers
or even the simpler Servlet Containers. The method should be used in replacement of disconnect() in all those circumstances where it
is indispensable to guarantee a complete shutdown of all user threads, in order to avoid potential memory leaks and waste resources.<br/>
See the docs for further details about the proper usage pattern for this method.

<p>Added two new properties to ConnectionInfo (namely ConnectTimeoutMillis
   and ReadTimeoutMillis), to enforce timeouts for the socket connection
   and socket read tasks.<br/>
   This also fixes the documentation of OpenConnection and related methods
   in LSClient, where it was described a different way to set such timeouts.
   Actually, this feature was available only in the old .NET SDK and was
   removed upon the move to the .NET PCL SDK.</p>

<p>Added automatic recovery of sessions upon unexpected socket interruption during
   streaming or long polling. Now the library will perform an attempt to resume
   the session from the interruption point. The attempt may or may not succeed,
   also depending on the Server configuration of the recovery capability;
   so, note that an interruption followed by a failed recovery attempt may not
   be notified by a PushConnException, but by a different exception.<br/>
   Added the RecoveryTimeoutMillis property in ConnectionInfo to regulate
   recovery attempts.<br/>
   Extended the scope of the OnActivityWarning notification on IConnectionListener
   to include the period in which a recovery attempt is in place.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If an existing client takes
   decisions based on OnActivityWarning, it should be considered that the time
   elapsed after the warning may now be longer than ProbeTimeoutMillis,
   depending on RecoveryTimeoutMillis.</span></p>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0.0 which caused the PollingMillis setting to be ignored.
   If pure synchronous polling was used (i.e. if combined with a setting of 0 for
   PollingIdleMillis), this could have caused a tight loop of requests to the Server
   (unless the latter was protected with &lt;min_interpoll_millis&gt;).</p>

<p>Extended the invocations of OnNewBytes in the ConnectionListener to also report
   the reception of a Server keepalive. In such cases, the "bytes" argument will be 0.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If an existing client leans on the
   fact that it never receives 0 from OnNewBytes, it should be revised. But note that
   a 0 value from OnNewBytes was not explicitly excluded by the previous interface
   contract.</span></p>

<div class="version">2.1.0 build 1859</div>

<p>Added session error code 21 and control error code 11, that can be received
   instead of, respectively, session error code 20 and control error code 20,
   to inform that not only a specified session was not found but it is also likely
   that the request was routed to the wrong Server instance.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing clients using version 2.0.0

   the new error codes are also handled properly.</span>
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing clients using version 2.1.0

<p>Extended the scope of REQERR code 41 on the various MPN requests to all issues related
   with resource unavailability in the Server preventing the operation. Previously,
   such issues could have caused a ERROR response with code 68.</p>

<p>Clarified in the documentation the use of percent encoding.</p>

<p>Clarified in the documentation how to distinguish notifications that carry
   snapshot information from real-time updates.</p>

<p>Added clarifications on licensing matters in the documentation.</p>


<div class="version">2.1.0 build 1851</div>

<p>Introduced the support for Mobile Push Notifications. It consists in:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>New available requests to the Server to register a target device and activate
       special MPN subscriptions that will be delivered via mobile push notifications
       to the device. The device identification is in charge to the application.</li>
       <li>New real-time notifications in the current session, which confirm
       the fulfilment of the requests.</li>
       <li>A special Data Adapter, available in all Adapter Sets, that supplies
       items carrying the current state of the MPN subscriptions for the
       currently registered device.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>An MPN subscription is backed by a real-time subscription, from which it may take
   any field value. Unlike the usual real-time subscriptions, MPN subscriptions are persistent:
   they survive the session and are identified by a permanent, global, unique key provided
   by the Server at time of activation.<br/>
   The notifications are managed by third-party services supported by the Server,
   which determine the notification characteristics and the supported devices.
   See the protocol documentation for details.<br/>
   <span class="notInAPV">However, the support for Mobile Push Notifications
   by Lightstreamer Server (i.e. the MPN Module) is not available with this edition.</span></p>
   
<p>Added the support for recovery of sessions upon unexpected socket interruption during
   streaming or long polling.
   This involves an extension of the bind_session command (see LS_recovery_from), with
   a new error code (4) for CONERR, and a new Server notification (PROG). See the revised
   "Session Life Cycle" paragraph and the related "Session Recovery" example in chapter 6
   for details.</p>

<p>Introduced the "heartbeat" pseudo-request to probe sockets and keep them alive.<br/>
   Added the "LS_inactivity_millis" request parameter to create_session and bind_session
   to leverage Server-side checks of client activity and heartbeats.</p>

<p>Removed redundant uses of the SERVNAME and CLIENTIP notifications, by allowing them
   to be omitted on Session rebinds when unchanged with respect to the previous time.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing clients using version 2.0.0
   and managing SERVNAME and/or CLIENTIP, in order to upgrade to 2.1.0, should ensure
   that they keep the previous value upon each rebind; in particular, they cannot expect
   SERVNAME and/or CLIENTIP to be always received on rebind.</span></p>

<p>Added the new Server error code 71 to the session error codes.</p>

<p>Clarified the syntax documentation to detail how requests can be mapped onto the
   various transports (HTTP POST, WS messages, and the added case of HTTP GET).<br/>
   Also clarified the requirements in terms of percent-encoding in the various cases,
   by specifying for which characters the encoding is mandatory (whereas for all
   other characters it is optional). Improved the provided examples accordingly,
   by removing unnecessary encoding.</p>

<p>Restricted various syntax checks on the requests to become case-sensitive.
   This is not meant as a change of the TLCP protocol specifications, which
   always specify the correct case for the keywords. However, some examples
   in the protocol documentation reported the LS_reqId parameter with a wrong
   case and have now been fixed.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing clients using version
   2.0.0 in which incorrect case is used, perhaps because inspired by some of the
   provided examples, have to be fixed.</span></p>


<div class="version">2.0.0 build 1809</div>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with custom clients sticking to the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 23 Jan 2017</div></span>

<p>Thoroughly redesigned the protocol, mainly on the response side. The new protocol,
   named TLCP, helps achieving various improvements, such as the following:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>full support for WebSockets, as transport for both streaming and control requests;</li>
   <li>protocol versioning;</li>
   <li>notification of successful subscriptions and unsubscriptions within the update flow;</li>
   <li>detailed error messages also for syntax errors;</li>
   <li>support for independent execution of the requests in a batch;</li>
   <li>notification of the bandwidth and frequency constraints applied by the Server;</li>
   <li>notification of subscription metadata determined by the Server;</li>
   <li>full support for Adapter's ClearSnapshot requests;</li>
   <li>discontinuation of the use of zero values to carry special meanings, in both requests and responses;</li>
   <li>notification of server-side timestamps, to allow for detection of data transport delays;</li>
   <li>notification of server-side client IP, to allow for detection of changes in connection routing;</li>
   <li>support for subscription requests embedded in session opening requests;</li>
   <li>injection of custom cause messages in session destroy requests.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>See the included documentation for any details.</br>
   Any custom clients based on the previous versions of the protocol are still
   supported by Lightstreamer Server.</p>

<p>Redefined the SDK version, which is now 2.0.0 and also represents the version of the
   underlying TLCP protocol. It is meant that any explicit or implicit reference
   to the "previous" versions of the SDK may include version 6.0.3 or earlier.
   The supplied build number is still increasing and can be used to disambiguate.</p>


<div class="version">6.0.3 build 1803</div>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with custom clients for the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 5 Sep 2016</div></span>

<p>Restricted the syntax checks on the requests, so that some illegal cases
   that used to be accepted are now refused. For instance, negative numeric
   values were, in some cases, treated like missing values and replaced with
   defaults. <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: No client
   is expected to fall into the above illegal cases.</span></p>


<div class="version">6.0.2 build 1794</div>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 10 May 2016</div></span>

<p>Added the LS_cause_code parameter to LS_op=destroy requests. The supplied
   codes will now be possible cause codes of the "END" message.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: The newly available codes
   are not to be expected from the "END" message, unless extended invocations
   of LS_op=destroy requests are introduced.</span></p>

<p>Clarified the use of the Control Link in the protocol documentation.</p>

<div class="compatibility">Compatible with custom clients for the previous version.</div>
<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 13 Feb 2015</div></span>

<p>Added the cause code 48 upon the "END" message (asynchronous close).
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: The code can be issued only
   if the new &lt;max_session_duration_minutes&gt; setting (introduced with Lightstreamer Server
   build 1741) is used, hence custom clients don't have to be updated to take
   the code into account, as long as the Server configuration is not changed.</span></p>

<div class="compatibility">Not compatible with custom clients for the previous version;

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 21 Jan 2015</div></span>

<p>Extended the protocol to support the new client identification mechanism.
   See the added parameters for the "create_session.txt" request.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing clients have to be
   extended with the new parameters in order to comply with the current
   and future versions of the protocol; however, Lightstreamer Server always guarantees
   the support for old clients.</span></p>

<p>Added the error code 30 upon control.txt; the case is only predisposed for future special
   licenses.<span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: custom clients which
   check the possible error outcomes don't have to be updated, as long as there is
   no change in license terms.</span></p>

<p>Removed the error code 14 upon create_session/bind_session, as it is no longer
   issued. The check was related with the use in custom clients of the Adapter Set
   used by the Monitor Console/Dashboard, which is an undocumented (and unneeded) option.</p>

<p>Fixed a clarification comment on the protocol documentation: the single quote
   is expected to be escaped in field values, not the double quote.</p>

<p>Updated the included examples, to reflect changes in Lightstreamer Server
   default configuration and predeployed Adapters.</p>

<span class="notInAMS"><div class="date">Released on 22 Jul 2014</div></span>

<p>Extended the syntax with the "Preamble" element in the response header, which
   may be used in specific cases for padding purpose only.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: existing custom clients that perform
   strict checks on the response headers may refuse the response and eventually fail
   to establish a session, hence they should be extended. Backward compatibility can
   be enforced by removing the new &lt;use_enriched_content_type&gt; configuration
   setting.</span></p>
