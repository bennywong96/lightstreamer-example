LIGHTSTREAMER - PYTHON ADAPTER DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES
====================================================

This directory includes the resources needed to write Data Adapters and
Metadata Adapters for Lightstreamer Server in a Python environment.
The adapters will run in a separate process, communicating with the Proxy 
Adapters deployed inside the Lightstreamer Server through the 
Adapter Remoting Infrastructure.

Refer to the Lightstreamer/DOCS-SDKs/adapter_remoting_infrastructure for
an overview of the general architecture and deploy instructions for the 
Proxy Adapters.
