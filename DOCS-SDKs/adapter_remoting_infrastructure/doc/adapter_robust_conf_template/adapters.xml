             In this case, "ROBUST_PROXY_FOR_REMOTE_ADAPTER" is a special
             keyword that identifies the Robust Proxy Metadata Adapter, which
             is embedded in Lightstreamer Server and available out of the box.
             The Robust Proxy Metadata Adapter communicates with its remote
             counterpart through standard TCP sockets. It listens on a specific
             port and waits for its counterpart to connect.
             Moreover, this Metadata Adapter manages the case in which the remote
             counterpart is missing, by just refusing all new requests from the
             clients and storing all state change notifications that have to be
             sent to the backend (namely, session closing and table closing
             notifications).
             Meanwhile, this Metadata Adapter keeps waiting for a connection
             from a new remote server; upon connection, it will flush pending
             notifications, then start working normally. However, if the remote
             counterpart has restarted from scratch, then retrieving and
             restoring the state of the previously connected instance will be
             its own burden; for how to identify the involved Server instance,
             see "remote_params_prefix" below.
             Note that the unavailability of the Metadata Adapter is a severe
             issue for Lightstreamer and all client requests performed in this
             condition will fail with an "unexpected error" notification;
             this can be avoided only for requests for new sessions (see
             "notify_user_disconnection_code" below). -->

        <!-- Optional.
             The strategy to be adopted whenever a new remote server is available
             in order to resend the state change notifications that could not
             or might not have been sent to the previous remote server.
             This involves the notifications of session closing and the optional
             notifications of table closing.
             Note that the Proxy Adapter has no way of knowing exactly if a
             notification has been processed by a remote server if no answer
             had been received at the time the connection was closed. Also
             Consider that the answers from the remote server are not expected
             to come in the same sequence as the requests.
             Hence, no perfect recovery is possible and the remote server must
             be able to deal with an imperfect notification sequence.
             Currently, the only available options are:

             - pessimistic
               All notifications since the first one that could not or may not
               have been processed by the previous remote server are resent
               to the new one.
               This ensures that all notifications are processed at least once,
               but may cause some notifications to be issued for a second time.
               Even notifications that did get an answer could be resent,
               in order to preserve the original sequence.
               Note that timed out requests (see the "timeout" setting) are
               considered as processed.

             - optimistic
               Only notifications after the last one that got an answer by the
               previous remote server are resent to the new one.

             - unneeded
               No notifications are resent. In case the close notifications
               are ignored by the remote server implementation, this can save
               a possibly long playback of unneeded messages.
               Note that table notifications, for both opening and closing, are
               already omitted, unless requested by the remote server through
               the wantsTablesNotification method.

             Default: pessimistic. -->

             If configured, the unavailability case will be managed by throwing
             a CreditsException with this code specified; in this way, upon
             a request for a new session, the code will be communicated to the
             client as a Metadata Adapter custom refusal code.
             The code must be zero or negative, as positive codes are reserved
             by the Server.

             replacement of a previous instance for the same Proxy Adapter
             instance, and to possibly recover the state, including the currently
             active sessions and the related users.

             retry accepting more connection attempts after waiting for this time.

             The timeout for the first connection attempt. Upon the Proxy Adapter

             is not available, Lightstreamer Server startup can be delayed until
             this timeout expires.

             all subscription requests will get an empty snapshot; then, when the
             connection is established, the data flow will be restored according
             to the "events_recovery" setting.
             Default: 0. -->
        <param name="first_connection_timeout_millis">10000</param>

        <!-- Optional.
             The strategy to be adopted whenever a new remote server is available
             in order to restore the data flow for items that were subscribed to
             while no remote server was available.
             No sophisticated recovery algorithms are available, as they could
             only depend on the specific item meanings.
             Currently, the only available options are:

             - leave_hole
               The real time update flow is just restarted; this may give rise
               to an inconsistent overall flow:
               for RAW and DISTINCT subscriptions, there will be a hole in the
               event sequence;
               for MERGE and COMMAND subscriptions, out of date field values
               might be mixed with up to date field values on the same item or key;
               for COMMAND subscriptions, some keys might be missing for some
               time and others might remain garbage for long time; some harmless
               warning messages might also be issued by the Server.

             - use_snapshot
               The snapshot of the item is requested to the remote server and
               it is sent in the update flow "as is"; this strategy is suitable
               for MERGE subscriptions, while in other cases it may give rise
               to an inconsistent overall flow:
               for RAW subscriptions, there will be a hole in the event sequence
               and possible spurious entries;
               for DISTINCT subscriptions, there might be either a hole or some
               duplicates in the event sequence;
               for COMMAND subscriptions, some keys might just remain garbage
               for long time; some harmless warning messages might also be
               issued by the Server.

             - enforce_snapshot
               Upon interruption, a ClearSnapshot event is sent. Then, upon
               reconnection, the snapshot of the item is requested to the remote
               server and it is sent in the update flow as though it was a sequence
               of real-time updates; this strategy successfully restores the
               correct state for MERGE and COMMAND subscriptions, but it must be
               considered that:
               for MERGE subscriptions, the clients will see null values during
               the interruption;
               for RAW subscriptions, there will be a hole in the event sequence
               and possible spurious entries;
               for DISTINCT subscriptions, there might be either a hole or some
               duplicates in the event sequence, but the ClearSnapshot signal may
               act as a warning of the issue;
               for COMMAND subscriptions, the clients will see an empty list
               during the interruption, then the fictitious ADDs to restore the
               list, but the ClearSnapshot signal may act as a warning of the issue.

             The configured strategy will be applied with all items.
             Default: leave_hole. -->
        <param name="events_recovery">use_snapshot</param>

        <!-- Optional.
             Specifies an item name to be managed by the Proxy Adapter for
             carrying information about the availability of the Remote Data Adapter.
             This item will only supply one field, named "status", whose value
             may only be one of the following:
             - "connecting" if no connection with a remote server has taken place yet;
             - "connected" if a connection with a remote server is currently in place;
             - "reconnecting" if a connection with a remote server has been lost.
             The item will support subscriptions in MERGE or RAW mode and requests
             for the snapshot will also be supported.

             Note that the chosen name should be such that no conflicts with the
             item names supplied by the Remote Data Adapter can be possible.
             Also note that the Metadata Adapter must be aware of this item when
             performing permission checks.
             Default: no item is added for carrying status information. -->
        <param name="status_item">remote_adapter_status</param>

        <!-- Optional for all Proxy Data Adapters.
             Timeout that is activated when the first connection (either to the
             request/reply or the notification port) has been received.
             If the second connection is not received within this time,
             the first connection is also invalidated.
             A zero or negative value stands for an unlimited timeout.

             and threads when assessing problems.
             If not specified, the Adapter Set id and the Data Adapter name, as configured
             in this file, will be used. -->

             If true, the Proxy Adapter will wait for the completion of the
             initialization of the remote counterpart before beginning to
             forward requests; any exception occurred during initialization
             will be received.
             It can be set to false only in order to enforce compatibility
             with remote servers compliant with ARI version older than 1.5,
             which don't support remote initialization requests;
             on the other hand, a setting to false would not be supported by
             remote servers compliant with ARI version 1.5 or newer.
             Default: true. -->

             Determines the initialization parameters to be sent to the remote
             counterpart.
             The supplied value is meant as a prefix, such that all parameters
             supplied to this Proxy Adapter and whose names start with this
             prefix will be sent (an empty value is also supported, to match
             all parameters).
             Moreover, the following parameters, with obvious meaning, will
             also be sent:
             - adapters_conf.id
             - data_provider.name
             - proxy.instance_id
             where the latter is added by the Robust Proxy Data Adapter and
             allows a Remote Data Adapter to detect if it is in replacement
             of a previous instance for the same Proxy Adapter instance.
             Default: if not defined, no initialization parameters will be
             sent at all. -->

             Specifies a comma-separated list of hosts allowed to connect to this proxy adapter
             in order to act as remote adapters.
             If a list is specified, connections received from addresses not in the list will be
             turned down, otherwise any connection will be accepted.
             The addresses can be in any form accepted by Java InetAddress.getByName method. -->

        <!-- Optional for all Proxy Data Adapters.
             Timeout for received data from the Remote Data Adapter; it applies
             independently on the request-reply and the notify connection.
             If no data (nor keepalives) is received within the specified timeout,
             the TCP connection will be considered broken and will be reset;
             as a consequence, a connection with a new Remote Data Adapter
             will be attempted.
             Setting a timeout is only meaningful if the Remote Data Adapter
             is configured to send keepalive messages on both connections
             at a shorter interval.
             A negative value stands for an unlimited timeout.
             Default: -1 (unlimited timeout). -->
