LIGHTSTREAMER - JAVA SE CLIENTS (UNIFIED API) - DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES
=====================================================================

This directory points to the various resources needed to develop a 
Java application that works as a client of Lightstreamer Server.

This SDK is designed for Java Standard Edition (a.k.a. Java SE or J2SE).
JDK or JRE version 7 or later is required.

This client implements the Lightstreamer Unified Client API.
The goal of the Unified API is to offer a common set of
interfaces and functionalities across different languages
and platforms.
In addition to the standard features required by any kind of 
Lightstreamer client, the Unified Client API provides several
others, including:
* Support for automatic re-connections and re-subscriptions.
* Completely asynchronous interfaces: all blocking operations
are performed on dedicated threads.

This library is distributed through a Maven repository, see the
lib folder for details and instructions.
