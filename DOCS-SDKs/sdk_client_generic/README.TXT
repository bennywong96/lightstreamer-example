LIGHTSTREAMER - GENERIC CLIENT DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES
====================================================

This directory includes the documentation of the TLCP Protocol, based on
HTTP and WebSocket, used by Lightstreamer Server to communicate with the Clients
(although some client libraries may still be using older protocols).

This SDK enables the development of any Lightstreamer Client by working at
HTTP/WebSocket level, without leveraging the client libraries provided within
the other SDKs.
